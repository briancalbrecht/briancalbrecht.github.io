Wampum was Colonial Money
====================================
.left-column[
- Know to economists as a **colonial money**

- Today: money = medium of exchange

- E.g., Friedman (1951); Samuelson (1951) 

- Shells were broken into beads and strung into belts

- Legal tender in New Netherlands

- Official exchange rate in Massachusetts Bay Colony
]

]


---
Wampum was **NOT** Iroquois Money
====================================

.left-column[
- Contrary to Friedman, Samuelson, etc, the Iroquois **did not use wampum as a money**
  - Archeologists: Tooker (1978); Snyderman (1954)

- Yet wampum was extremely valuable for the Iroquois. Why?
  - “the magnet which drew the beaver out”- Weeden (1884)
    
- Today's talk lays out and partially resolves some puzzles about wampum as money and non-money

---
Two Themes of Today's Talk
====================================

### Monetary Case Study (Expanded for Today)

- Non-monetary society forced into contact with monetary society

- Certain people can use a good as money even if others do not

- If not as money, why was wampum valuable to Iroquois?

--

### Wampum as Institution (Circulated Draft)

- Wampum fostered peaceful cooperation and the division of labor without resorting to a sovereign to enforce agreements

- But wigid institutions that fail to adapt can go from beneficial to harmful

# Wampum as Colonial Money

---
New Netherlands Facts
========================

- 

- Pure fiat money, no "instrinic value"

- 

---
Why Wampum?
=======================
Standard characteristics of a good medium of exchange

- Durable

- Divisible

- Recognizable

- Easy to transport



---
Medium of Exchange in Fur Trade
========================

- Wampum was produce by Algonquian tribe, consumed by Iroquois

- No evidence of trade between Algonquians and Iroquois, although they were in contact
  - Zero coincidence of wants

- The arrival of Europeans
  - Created single coincidence of wants
  
- Wampum overcame the issue of single coincidence of wants

- Near perfect example of Menger, Kiyotaki and Wright (1989)

---
Atypical Money
===========================

- Only Europeans used as a general medium of exchange
  1. International trade
  2. Domestic

- Never became money for Iroquois (unlike Barbarians with Romans)

- From the Iroquois, it was a barter-type exchange: `$$\text{Furs} \Longleftrightarrow \text{Wampum}$$`

- “white man fooled himself into believing wampum was Indian money”- Snyderman (1954)

- Monetary story could stop there, as monetary oddity

---
Value to Iroquois
=========================

- Whole trade system relied on the Iroquois valuing wampum extremely highly

- “the most precious article they possess” -Tremblay (2006)

- "high value given wampum by the Iroquois that created wealth for the Europeans and colonials, that underlay colonial ‘confidence’ in this unusual shell bead coinage, and that contributed finally to the success of colonial expansion." - Ceci (1982)

- But why?

# The Great Peace


---
Wampum's Early History
=====================================

- Earliest uses go to the Condolence Council, a predecessor to the Iroquois League

- Upon the death of a chief, wampum was given as a gift

- Peace offering quelled political turmoil

- Condolence Council initiated The Great Peace
  - Peace among the Five Nations for over three hundred years

- “Wampum, the chief instrument of the Council, became the vehicle necessary for all important political transactions” - Snyderman (1954, 479)



---
Institutional Roles for the Iroqouis
====================================

### 1. Memory: the pre-literate society could “write” down their obligations

### 2. Screening: wampum "gifts" were costly signals to separate good trading partners from bad


---
Memory Role
==========================

- Recorded the words of the Condolence Council

- Belts were mnemonic devices, not written words

- Regularly “read” aloud and posted publicly 

- Wampum was a public record
  
- In particular, wampum established, recorded, and enforced reciprocal obligations
  - Like a debt (credit?) contract without a unit of payment
  - Cost of production limited the amount of debts created

---

# The Early Colonial Period



---
Screening Role
=========================

- Upon arrival of Europeans, wampum was used in all international negotiations	

- Besides being a public record, wampum was also a gift from one side to another
  
- Especially costly signal: 7 days of work per 6 foot belt

- In addition, Europeans hadd to learn and participate in an elaborate ceremony
  - Lowering social distance (Akerlof 1997, Leeson 2008)

- Only patient groups wanting to invest in long-term trade relations would pay the cost





---
Institutional Shock
===================================

- However, European arrival brought European tools

- Signal becomes less costly
  - Production costs decreased by factor of ten

- Wampum production skyrockets
  - Some early anthropologists thought wampum only came after European contact

- Colonists would promise more than they would deliver 
  - Goods, protection, land

---
Institutional Tragedy
===================================

- An efficient system would change with the costs
  - Decreased cost =&gt; shift of supply =&gt; decreased marginal value 

- Instead forest diplomacy became more important

- 18th century saw forest diplomacy’s “perfection” (Fenton 1998, 7)
 
- And the loss of the Iroquois’s last settlements in New York State (Foster 1985, 100–101). 

---
Institutional Elites
==================================

Middlemen or cultural brokers benefited from forest diplomacy

Their “intermediate position, one step removed from final responsibility in decision making, occasionally allows brokers to promise more than they can deliver” 
	-Richter (1988, 41).

Cultural brokers could “slant speeches in ways advantageous to himself”- Jennings (1984, 63).



---
The Wampum Legacy
==================================

- Wampum was an effective institution for over three hundred years for promoting cooperation

- Promoted cooperation through two roles:
  - Memory
  - Screening

- Dual institutional role:
  - Money among Europeans Dutch
  - Contract/treaty between tribes and Europeans

- After colonial expansion, wampum became ineffective

- Yet, the Iroquois continued to rely on wampum 
  - Possible tension: Iroquois kept wampum because certain people still benefited 


---
Implications for Today
================================

--
- None

economies. That being said, surely the more common
occurrence throughout history was when a society that did not use money came into contact with
one that did. (E.g., when Germanic barbarian groups came into sustained contact with the Roman
Empire in the first century AD.)

---
Wampum was effective for the Iroquois League before and immediately after the arrival of European colonists

The exchange of wampum promoted reciprocity and enforced credible commitment

Colonists degraded the credible commitment

Yet the Iroquois increased their use of wampum, leading to further exploitation by the colonists

---
Three Stages of Wampum's History
====================================

### 1. The Great Peace
  - \~ 1390 - 1621
  - Wampum belts "exchanged" between tribes as peace offerings

--

### 2. Early Colonial
  - 1621 - \~ 1700
  - Wampum facilitates peaceful fur trade with Dutch/English/French

--

### 3. Later Colonial
  - After 1700
  - Wampum continues to be used while trade relations fall apart
