Iroquois and Wampum
====================================

.pull-left[
- Wampum is most famous for econs as a colonial money
    - Legal tender in New Netherlands (New York)
    - Official exchange rate in MA Bay Colony

- The Iroquois did not use wampum as a money
    - Tooker (1978, 423), Snyderman (1954, 470), Woodward (1878, 20)

- Yet wampum was extremely valuable for the Iroquois
    - “the magnet which drew the beaver out”- Weeden (1884, 15)

---
Two Main Points
====================================

## Monetary Economics
- Wampum provides a unique case study in the theory and historical development of monies




# Institutional Economics
- Wampum shows how rigid institutions that fail to adapt go from beneficial to hamful

---
Wampum was effective for the Iroquois League before and immediately after the arrival of European colonists

The exchange of wampum promoted reciprocity and enforced credible commitment

Colonists degraded the credible commitment

Yet the Iroquois increased their use on wampum, leading to further exploitation by the colonists




---
Wampum's Role
====================================


Instead of money, wampum was a political and economic institution: more like a contract

Established, recorded, and enforced reciprocal obligations

Screening: gifts, as costly signals, separate good trading partners from bad ones

Memory: the pre-literate society could “write” down their obligations

---
Wampum's History
=====================================

Condolence Council, a predecessor to the Iroquois League

Upon the death of a chief, wampum was given as a gift

Peace offering quelled political turmoil

Costly signal: 7 days of work per 6 foot belt

Elaborate ceremony


---
Wampum's History
=====================================

Recorded the words of the Condolence Council

Belts were mnemonic devices, not written words

Regularly “read” aloud and posted publicly 

Wampum was a gift and a record
Debt contract without a unit of payment
Cost of production limited the amount of debts created



---
Wampum's History
=====================================
Condolence Council initiated The Great Peace
Peace among the Five Nations for over three hundred years

“Wampum, the chief instrument of the Council, became the vehicle necessary for all important political transactions” - Snyderman (1954, 479)

Upon arrival of Europeans, wampum was used in all international negotiations	
Forest diplomacy
Europeans needed to learn the rituals



---
Institutional Shock
===================================

European arrival brought European tools

Signal becomes less costly
Production costs decreased by factor of ten

Wampum production skyrockets
Some early anthropologists thought wampum only came after European contact

Colonists would promise more than they could deliver
Goods, protection, land

---
Institutional Tragedy
===================================

An efficient system would change with the costs
Decreased cost =&gt; shift of supply =&gt; decreased marginal value 

Instead forest diplomacy became more important

18th century saw forest diplomacy’s “perfection” (Fenton 1998, 7)
 
And the loss of the Iroquois’s last settlements in New York State (Foster 1985, 100–101). 

---
Institutional Elites
==================================

Middlemen or cultural brokers benefited from forest diplomacy

Their “intermediate position, one step removed from final responsibility in decision making, occasionally allows brokers to promise more than they can deliver” 
	-Richter (1988, 41).

Cultural brokers could “slant speeches in ways advantageous to himself”- Jennings (1984, 63).



---
The Wampum Legacy
==================================

Wampum was an effective institution for over three hundred years for promoting cooperation

Promoted cooperation through two roles:
Screening
Memory

After colonial expansion, wampum became ineffective

Yet, the Iroquois continued to rely on wampum 

Iroquois kept wampum because certain people still benefitted

economies. That being said, surely the more common
occurrence throughout history was when a society that did not use money came into contact with
one that did. (E.g., when Germanic barbarian groups came into sustained contact with the Roman
Empire in the first century AD.)
