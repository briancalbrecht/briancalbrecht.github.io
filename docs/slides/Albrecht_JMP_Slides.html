---
Competitive Coordination
====================================


- What if there are **many players** and they are **operating in a market**?

--

- These features matter because important real-world investments are sunk before entering a market with many players

--

  - Invest in education before being hired
  - Produce goods before having a buyer
&lt;!---  - Write JMP before knowing schools want a general equilibrium theorist ---&gt;

--

- When investments are sunk, *i.e.* when markets are incomplete, coordination failures can arise even with competitive markets
  - Makowski &amp; Ostroy (1995), Cole, Malaith, &amp; Postlewaite (1999a, 1999b), Makowski (2004), N&amp;ouml;ldeke &amp; Samuelson (2014), Felli &amp; Roberts (2016)

--
  
- Previous literature only studied **existence of coordination failures**



---
My Question
====================================


- Are the market investments we observe likely to be inefficient? 


- **Are coordination failures robust**?


- Should we predict coordination failures?

--

## My Answer

- **No**, if markets are competitive


- Formally, inefficient equilibria are not robust to errors in a trembling-hand refinement


`\(\Rightarrow\)` We should predict efficient market outcomes

Sketch of General Environment
====================================

- Continuum of buyers and sellers, finite types

- Transferable utility

--

.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_B.png)]

???
Simple set up to focus on the coordination aspect

Ignore hold-up, bargaining issues




---
Example
====================================

- Agents are endowed with a type `\(t \in T = \{\beta, \sigma\}\)`: "buyer" or "seller"

  - Measure one of both

- Buyers choose an investment `\(b \in B= \{0,1\}\)`

- Sellers choose an investment `\(s \in S = \{0,1\}\)`

--

- Cost to buyer = `\(\frac{1}{4}b\)`

- Cost to seller = `\(\frac{1}{4}s\)`

- Surplus `\(v(b,s) = bs\)` of matching



  

---
Stage 2: Matching Market
===================================


- A buyer `\(b\)` chooses a **match contract** `\((b,s) \in \left\{(b,0) , (b,1)\right\}\)` guaranteeing the right to join a match with `\(s\)`

- A seller `\(s\)` chooses `\((b,s) \in \left\{(0,s) , (1,s)\right\}\)`

--

- Matches have competitive prices: `\(p : B \times S \to \mathbb{R}\)`

- `\(p(b,s)\)`: transfer from buyer with `\(b\)` to seller with `\(s\)`


--

- Matching market indirect utility for `\(b\)`:

`$$v^*_b(p) = \max_{s}\left\{ v(b,s) - p(b,s) \right\}$$`

--

- Matching market indirect utility for `\(s\)`:

`$$v^*_s(p) = \max_{b}\left\{ p(b,s) \right\}$$`


---
Stage 1: Decision Problem
==============================


- Agents only have **price conjectures**: `\(\tilde{p}^t : B \times S \to \mathbb{R}\)`
  
  - Not a distribution but can think of conjectures = expected price
    
--

- Buyer's investment problem: `$$\max_{b} \left\{\underbrace{ v^*_b\left(\tilde{p}^\beta\right)}_{\text{Utility from Conjectured Optimal Contract}}  - \underbrace{\frac{1}{4}b}_{\text{Investment Cost}}\right\}$$`

--

- Seller's investment problem: `\(\max_{s} \left\{ v^*_s\left(\tilde{p}^\sigma\right)  - \frac{1}{4}s\right\}\)`

---
Investment Equilibrium
====================================



1. Each buyer chooses `\((b,s)\)` to maximize utility, given `\(\tilde{p}^\beta(b,s)\)`

2. Each seller chooses `\((b,s)\)` to maximize utility, given `\(\tilde{p}^\sigma(b,s)\)`

--

3. Rational conjectures: conjectures are not contradicted by the data
  - If positive mass of agents choose contract `\((b,s)\)`, conjectures agree with the posted price: `\(\tilde{p}^\beta (b,s)=\tilde{p}^\sigma (b,s)= p(b,s)\)`
  
  - Otherwise conjectures are not pinned down 

--

4. Prices clear matching markets
  - Mass of buyers choosing `\((b,s)\)` = mass of sellers choosing `\((b,s)\)`

  
???
Informal Definition

---
Example Payoffs
=====================================

.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_G.png)]

--
- Prices and conjectures are endogenous

- Rational conjectures: if a match `\((b,s)\)` is chosen, `\(\tilde{p}^\beta (b,s)= \tilde{p}^\sigma (b,s)= p(b,s)\)`

- Allows disagreement "off-path" (self-confirming equilibrium)

???
We need to find conjectures and prices


---

Constructing Equilibria
====================================

- Efficient equilibrium: `\(b=s=1\)`

  - Suppose realized prices: `\(p(1,1)= \frac{1}{2}\)`
  - Non-contradicting conjectures: `\(\tilde{p}^\beta = \tilde{p}^\sigma = 0\)` otherwise

Constructing Equilibria
====================================

- Efficient equilibrium: `\(b=s=1\)`

  - Suppose realized prices: `\(p(1,1)= \frac{1}{2}\)`
  - Non-contradicting conjectures: `\(\tilde{p}^\beta = \tilde{p}^\sigma = 0\)` otherwise
    

- Coordination failure: `\(b=s=0\)`

  - Realized prices: `\(p(0,0)=0\)`
  - **Contradicting** conjectures: 
      - To prevent buyer deviating: `\(\tilde{p}^\beta (1,1) = 1 \geq \frac{3}{4}\)`
      - To prevent seller deviating: `\(\tilde{p}^\sigma(1,1) = 0 \leq \frac{1}{4}\)`

---

Constructing Equilibria
====================================

- Efficient equilibrium: `\(b=s=1\)`


- Coordination failure: `\(b=s=0\)`

--


- What are the efficiency implications?
  - Nothing: somewhere between maximum or minimum feasible surplus

???
SLOW SLOW SLOW

---
Refinement
=======================


- Multiplicity from a Nash-style equilibrium


- But one equilibria requires contradictory beliefs

--

- To discipline beliefs, I introduce a mild refinement

  - Trembling-hand perfection (Selten 1975)
  
  - Simple way to capture mistakes/experimentation

- Show which equilibria are robust/stable to small mistakes


???
Robert Lucas taught us to beware of theorists bearing free parameters

---
Perturbed Strategies
====================================

When defining trembles,

1. Symmetric trembling hand only at investment stage: 
  - Each investment must be chosen with positive probability `\(\epsilon(b), \epsilon(s) &gt;0\)` by each buyer and seller

1. Law of large numbers: in the aggregate each investment must be chosen by at least  `\(\epsilon(b)\)` buyers and  `\(\epsilon(s)\)` sellers

--

- Definition: A perfect equilibrium is limit of some sequence of equilibria for `\(\epsilon = (\epsilon(b),\epsilon(s)) \to (0,0)\)`

- **Claim**: The unique perfect equilibrium *allocation* is efficient


???
Symmetric: all players and all actions have same tremble
---
Uniqueness Proof
==========

- With trembling hand, each `\(b\)` and `\(s\)` are played `\(\Rightarrow\)` `\(\tilde{p}^\beta(b,s) = \tilde{p}^\sigma(b,s) = p(b,s)\)`

- Prices are no longer a free parameter

--

- Step 1: fix all prices besides markets besides `\(p(1,1)\)` at 0
  - Verify ex post this is part of equilibrium




---
`\(p(1,1) \in \left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]\)` 
================================================

.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_H.png)]

--

- Step 2: For `\(\epsilon &gt;&gt; 0\)`

- For `\(p(1,1) &gt; \frac{1}{4}\)`, all sellers choose `\((1,1)\)`

--

- For `\(p(1,1) &lt; \frac{3}{4}\)`. all buyers choose `\((1,1)\)` 

--
- For any price, someone wants to deviate from `\((0,0)\)`    




---
Supply and Demand for `\((1,1)\)`
==========

Step 3: For any `\(\epsilon &gt;&gt; 0\)`, again some price `\(p(1,1) \in \left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]\)` clears market

&lt;!--- - At that price, everyone wants to invest if they can match ---&gt;
&lt;!---  - `\(\text{min}\left\{1- \epsilon(b), 1- \epsilon(s)\right\}\)` invest on both sides ---&gt;

- For every `\(\epsilon \to (0,0)\)`, `\((1,1)\)` is the unique equilibrium strategy choice `\(\blacksquare\)`

--

- However, prices are not unique
- *e.g.* if equilibrium payoffs are `\(\frac{1}{4}\)`, other prices can be in `\(\left[0, \frac{1}{4}\right)\)`

--

- Indirectly proved no mixed strategy equilibrium (endogenous trembles)
  - This is different from 2-entrepreneur example

&lt;!--  - If someone is mixing between `\((0,0)\)` and `\((1,1)\)`, `\(p(1,1)\)` is public and either buyers or sellers strictly prefer `\((1,1)\)` --&gt;




---
Results for the Example
==============================

1. Inefficiencies (coordination failures) can occur under competition

2. However, coordination failures require contradictory beliefs

3. Mistakes/trembles eliminates contradictions `\(\Rightarrow\)` no coordination failures

4. [All perfect, competitive equilibria are efficient](#fulltalk)

--

- These results hold in a general environment 
 
---
Extending the Results
================================

- **Main Theorem**: for a general class of matching models with investments, all *perfect* investment equilibria are efficient

--

  - Single type on each side `\(\Rightarrow\)` general finite types, `\(\beta \in X,\sigma \in Y\)`
  
  - `\(B=S= \{0,1\} \Rightarrow\)` general finite investment levels
  
  - `\(\frac{1}{4}b, \frac{1}{4}s \Rightarrow\)` general cost of investment that can depend on types, `\(c\left(\beta, b\right)\)` and `\(c\left(\sigma, s\right)\)`
  
  -  Surplus function `\(b s \Rightarrow v(b,s)\)`


---
Structure of General Proof
================================

- General buyers' problem: `\(\max_{b,s} v(b,s) - \tilde{p}^\beta (b,s) - c\left(\beta, b\right)\)`

--

- General sellers' problem: `\(\max_{b,s}  \tilde{p}^\sigma (b,s)  - c\left(\sigma, s\right)\)`


--

- Total welfare, given measure over types `\(\mathcal{E}(\beta), \mathcal{E}(\sigma)\)`

`$$\sum_\beta \left[ \max_{b,s}  v(b,s) - \tilde{p}^\beta (b,s)- c\left(\beta, b\right)\right] \mathcal{E}(\beta)  +  \sum_\sigma \left[\max_{b,s}  \tilde{p}^\sigma (b,s)  - c\left(\sigma, s\right)\right]\mathcal{E}(\sigma)$$`
--

- Efficiency

`$$\max_{b,s}  \left\{  \sum_\beta \left[v(b,s)  - p(b,s)- c\left(\beta, b\right)\right]\mathcal{E}(\beta) +    
  \sum_\sigma\left[p(b,s) - c\left(\sigma, s\right)\right] \mathcal{E}(\sigma)\right\}$$`

--

- Since each agent is choosing both `\((b,s)\)`, total welfare = efficiency  `\(\blacksquare\)`

---
  Not *So* Simple
====================================

As in any paper, technical complications arise, *e.g.* I need to


1. Model an explicit competitive matching market, given fixed investments, compared to picking a match ex ante

1. Integrate the non-cooperative investment stage with the competitive matching market

1. Define a tremble and perfect equilibrium with a continuum of players

3. Investment Game where Players Choose Investments

  - Investment Equilibria
  - Perfect Investment Equilibria
  - Efficiency




---
Stage 1: Types
====================================

- General endowed types: `\(t \in T\)`

- Partitioned into 

  - Buyer endowed types: `\(\beta \in X\)`

  - Seller endowed types: `\(\sigma \in Y\)`



- Economy: a positive measure on `\(T\)`: `\(\mathcal{E} \in M_+(T)\)`



---
Stage 1: Investments
====================================

- General investments: `\(a \in A\)`

- Partitioned into

  - Buyer investments: `\(b \in B\)`
  
  - Seller investments: `\(s \in S\)`

--

- Type determines cost of acquiring investment `$$c : T \times A \to \mathbb{R} \cup {\infty}$$`

- `\(c(t,a)\)` is the cost to a type `\(t\)` of investment `\(a\)`

---
Stage 2: Matching Game Distribution
====================================

- Individual choices lead to distribution of investments `\(\mu \in M_+(A)\)`

  - Not keeping track of `\(M_+(T \times A)\)` 

- For any investment `\(a\)`, `\(\mu(a)\)` is the mass of individuals with investment `\(a\)`

  - Buyers: `\(\mu_b \in M_+(B)\)`
  
  - Sellers: `\(\mu_s \in M_+(S)\)`


---
Stage 2: Matching Game
====================================

- To allow individuals to remain unmatched, let `\(B^{\emptyset} \equiv B \cup \emptyset\)` and `\(S^{\emptyset} \equiv S \cup \emptyset\)`

- Bounded value function: `\(v : B^{\emptyset} \times S^{\emptyset} \to \mathbb{R}\)`

- Competitive prices: `\(p : B^{\emptyset} \times S^{\emptyset} \to \mathbb{R}\)`
  - Normalize: `\(p(b,\emptyset) \equiv p(\emptyset,s) \equiv 0\)`

--

- Could generalize to `\(v(\beta,b,\sigma,s)\)`, if sufficient prices `\(p(\beta,b,\sigma,s)\)`

- To focus on investment choice and coordination failures, I don't allow this


---
Stage 2: Matching Game
====================================

- A matching is a measure `$$x \in M_+ (B^{\emptyset} \times S^{\emptyset})$$`

- A matching `\(x\)` is **feasible** for `\(\mu\)` if `\(x(\emptyset,\emptyset)=0\)`, and
`$$\sum_{s' \in S^{\emptyset}}x(b,s') = \mu(b)~~~\forall b$$`
`$$\sum_{b' \in B^{\emptyset}}x(b', s) = \mu(s)~~~\forall s$$`






  
---
Stage 2: Equilibrium
====================================


&lt;font color=#125972&gt;&lt;b&gt;Definition:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The pair `\((x,p)\)` is an (ex post) **competitive equilibrium** for `\(\mu\)` if `\(x\)` is feasible for `\(\mu\)`,
--

- For each `\(b \in  \text{ supp } \mu_b\)` and each `\((b,s^*) \in \text{ supp } x,\)`
the match maximizes `\(b\)`'s utility:

--

`$$s^* \in \text{ argmax }_{s \in \text{ supp }  \mu_s }\left\{ v(b,s) - p(b,s)\right\},$$`
--

- For each `\(s \in  \text{ supp } \mu_s\)` and each `\((b^*,s) \in \text{ supp } x\)`, the match maximizes `\(s\)`'s utility:
--

`$$b^* \in \text{ argmax }_{s \in \text{ supp }  \mu_b } \left\{p(b,s)\right\}.$$`

???
Walk slowly through each


---
Stage 2: Efficiency
====================================

 

- Social matching gains function given `\(\mu\)`
`$$g(\mu) \equiv \text{max}_{x} \sum_{b \in B^{\emptyset}} \sum_{s \in S^{\emptyset}} v(b,s) x(b,s)~~~ s.t. x \text{ is feasible given } \mu$$`
- An allocation that attains `\(g(\mu)\)` is **conditionally efficient**


---
Stage 2: Efficiency
====================================
- **Conditional First Welfare Theorem**:  If a pair `\((x,p)\)` is competitive for `\(\mu\)`, then it is conditionally efficient

- It is conditional because maximization only holds within the support

- `\(\text{supp }\mu\)` may not include the ex ante efficient `\(b\)` and `\(s\)`

- Given the choice in a non-cooperative setting, do people choose the efficient `\(b\)` and `\(s\)`?

---
Stage 1: Investments
====================================

- Fix the ex ante population `\(\mathcal{E}\)`

- An allocation of investments is a measure `\(\nu \in M_+(T\times A)\)`
  - Marginals: `\(\nu_{T}, \nu_A\)`
  - `\(\mu = \nu_{A}\)`
  
- An allocation `\(\nu\)` is *feasible* for `\(\mathcal{E}\)` if `\(\nu_T = \mathcal{E}\)`

- Each agent of type `\(t\)` has price conjectures: `\(\tilde{p}^t : B^{\emptyset} \times S^{\emptyset} \to \mathbb{R}\)`

???
`\(\nu\)` is not v$
---
Conjectured Indirect Utility
====================================

- Define conjectured indirect utility of matching

- Buyer with `\(b\)` who conjectures `\(\tilde{p}^\beta\)`

`$$v^*_b\left(\tilde{p}^\beta\right) = \max_{s \in S^\emptyset}\left\{ v(b,s) - \tilde{p}^\beta(b,s)\right\}$$`
- Seller with `\(s\)` who conjectures `\(\tilde{p}\)`

`$$v^*_s\left(\tilde{p}^\sigma\right) = \max_{b \in B^\emptyset} \left\{\tilde{p}^\sigma(b,s)\right\}$$`


---
Investment Equilibrium
====================================

- A tuple `\(\left(\nu,\left\{ \tilde{p}^t\ \right\}_{t\in T},p,x\right)\)` is an **investment equilibrium** for `\(\mathcal{E}\)` if `\(\nu\)` is feasible, `\((x,p)\)` is a competitive equilibrium for `\(\nu_A\)`,

Buyers optimize their investment: for all `\((t,b) \in \text{supp } \nu\)`


`$$v_b^*(\tilde{p}^\beta) - c(t,b) \geq v^*_{b'}(\tilde{p}^\beta) - c(t,b') ~~~\forall b' \in B$$`


Sellers optimize: for all `\((s,t) \in \text{supp } \nu\)`

`$$v_s^*(\tilde{p}^\sigma) - c(s,t) \geq v^*_{s'}(\tilde{p}^\sigma) - c(s',t) ~~~\forall s' \in S$$`


Rational conjectures: $$\tilde{p}^t(b,s) = p(b,s) ~~\forall (b,s) \in \text{ supp } \mu_b \times  \text{ supp } \mu_s $$


---
Efficiency
====================================

- Total cost of investments `\(\nu\)` is `\(\sum_A \sum_T c(t,a) \nu(t,a).\)`

- Total surplus from `\(\nu\)` is
`$$G(\nu) = g(\nu_{A}) - \sum_A \sum_T c(t,a) \nu(t,a).$$`

- The allocation `\(\nu\)` is unconditionally **efficient** for `\(\mathcal{E}\)` if it is feasible and `\(G(\nu) \geq G(\nu')\)` for all other feasible allocation `\(\nu'\)`


---
Unconstrained Beliefs
====================================

- Without more structure, there will often be many equilibria

- Suppose not matching is generates no value generation: `\(v(\emptyset,s)=v(b,\emptyset)=0\)`
  - Often assumed in buyer/seller markets
  
- `\(b=0, s=0\)` can be part of an equilibrium through appropriate conjectures
  - No matter how large `\(v(b,s)\)` is, sellers can still rationally conjecture that `\(p(b,s)=0\)`

--

- Weakness of Nash equilibrium: 
  - In this class of matching games, the surplus maximizing **and minimizing** outcomes can occur


---
Need for Refinement
====================================

- Off-path beliefs are a free parameter

- Why would sellers conjecture `\(\tilde{p}^t(1,1) = 0\)`?

--

- Economists have recognized this issue in other competitive contexts:

  - Zame (2007) - "imposing no discipline would admit equilibria which are **viable only because different agents hold contradictory beliefs**"

--

  - Gale (1992) - "Typically, there exists a large number of equilibria and **some refinement of the equilibrium concept is required to give the theory predictive power**. One such refinement is based on the notion of the 'trembling' hand."


---
Perturbations
====================================

- Consider a perturbed strategy vector for all buyers, `\(\epsilon_B = (\epsilon(b))_{b \in B},\)` satisfying  `\(\epsilon(b)&gt;0\)` for all `\(b \in B\)` and 
`$$\sum_B \epsilon(b) \leq 1$$`
- For all sellers `\(\epsilon_S = (\epsilon(s))_{s \in S},\)` satisfying  `\(\epsilon(s)&gt;0\)` for all `\(s \in S\)` and 
`$$\sum_S \epsilon(s) \leq 1$$`

- A perturbed game is indexed by the vector of perturbed strategies `\(\epsilon = (\epsilon_B,\epsilon_S)\)`

---
`\(\epsilon\)`-Investment Equilibria
====================================

- An allocation `\(\nu(\epsilon)\)` is `\(\epsilon\)`-feasible for `\(\mathcal{E}\)` if  `\(\nu_T = \mathcal{E}\)` and for all `\(a \in A\)`
`$$\nu_{A}(\epsilon(a)) \geq \epsilon(a)$$`

- A tuple `\(\left(\nu(\epsilon), \left\{ \tilde{p}^t\ \right\}_{t\in T},p,x\right)\)` is an `\(\epsilon\)`-investment equilibrium for `\(\mathcal{E}\)` if `\(\nu\)` is `\(\epsilon\)`-feasible, `\(p\)` is a competitive price for `\(\nu_A\)`, and for all `\((t,a)\)` such that `\(\nu_{A}(\epsilon) &gt; \epsilon\)`,

`$$v_a^*(\tilde{p}^t) - c(t,a) \geq v^*_{a'}(\tilde{p}^t) - c(a',t) ~~~\forall a' \in A$$`

--

- Note that by construction, `\(\text{ supp } \nu_{A}(\epsilon) = A\)`

--

- A tuple  `\(\left(\nu,\left\{ \tilde{p}^t\ \right\}_{t\in T},p,x\right)\)` is a **perfect investment equilibria** if there exists a sequence of `\(\epsilon\)`, such that `\(\lim_{k \to \infty} M(\epsilon^k)=0\)` such that `\(\left(\nu(\epsilon),\left\{ \tilde{p}^t\ \right\}_{t\in T},p,x\right) \to \left(\nu,\left\{ \tilde{p}^t\ \right\}_{t\in T},p,x\right)\)`.

---
Restricted Efficiency
====================================
- The allocation `\(\nu(\epsilon)\)` is `\(\epsilon\)`-efficient for `\(\mathcal{E}\)` if it is feasible and `\(G(\nu(\epsilon)) \geq G(\nu'(\epsilon))\)` for all other `\(\epsilon\)`-feasible allocation `\(\nu'\)`

- **Lemma 1**: If `\((\nu(\epsilon), p)\)` is an `\(\epsilon\)`-investment equilibrium, then it is `\(\epsilon\)`-efficient.

--

- Proof: 

 Let `\(Q(\epsilon)\)` be the utility generated by the trembling actions

 `$$Q(\epsilon)=  \sum_b \left\{\sum_\beta  \left[v^*_b\left(\tilde{p}^\beta\right) - c(\beta,b)\right]\nu_T(\beta)\right\}\epsilon(b)$$`
 
`$$+ \sum_s \left\{\sum_\sigma  \left[v^*_s\left(\tilde{p}^\sigma\right) - c(\sigma,s)\right]\nu_T(\sigma)\right\}\epsilon(s).$$`


---
Proof (continued)
====================================

- Hence, 

`$$\sum_\beta \left[ \max_{b,s}  v(b,s) - \tilde{p}^\beta (b,s)- c\left(\beta, b\right)\right] \nu_T(\beta)\left( 1 - \epsilon(b)\right)$$`  

`$$+  \sum_\sigma \left[\max_{b,s}  \tilde{p}^\sigma (b,s)  - c\left(\sigma, s\right)\right]\nu_T(\sigma)\left( 1 - \epsilon(s)\right)$$`

&lt;!--$$\underbrace{\left(  \left[\max_b v(b,s) - \tilde{p}^\beta (b,s) - c\left(\beta, b\right)\right] + \left[\max_s  \tilde{p}^\sigma (b,s)  - c\left(\sigma, s\right)\right] \right) \left(1 - \sum_a \epsilon(a) \right)}_{\text{Optimized Choice}}$$--&gt;
$$ + \underbrace{Q(\epsilon)}_{\text{Constrained Choice}}$$

- But since all actions are played by trembles, `\(\tilde{p}^\beta(b,s) =\tilde{p}^\sigma(b,s)\)` 

- Therefore they optimize the entire left expression

- It is exactly the complete market problem, which is efficient `\(\qquad \blacksquare\)`


---
Full Efficiency
====================================

- **Theorem**: If  `\(\left(\nu,\left\{ \tilde{p}^t\ \right\}_{t\in T},p,x\right)\)` is a perfect investment equilibrium, then it is efficient.

--

- Proof: 

 Immediate from Lemma 1, since  `\(\underbrace{Q(\epsilon)}_{\text{Constrained Choice}} \to 0\)` `\(\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \blacksquare\)`

Common Conjectures Justifications
====================================

- Predictive power comes from imposing more restrictions on beliefs than just rational conjectures

- Trembling hand + large market `\(\Rightarrow\)` as-if complete markets

- Complete markets means rational conjectures `\(\Rightarrow\)` common conjectures 

--

- Other approaches:
  - Dubey and Geanakoplos (2002): fictitious seller who contributes an infinitesimal to each health insurance pool
  
  - Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik (2005): government intervenes to sell infinitesimal quantities of each asset and fully delivers on its promises
  
  - Zame (2007): only considers "common-belief" equilibria


---
Conclusion
====================================

- Under competition, coordination failures rely on using beliefs as a free parameter and constructing overly pessimistic conjectures

- Free parameter `\(\Rightarrow\)` many equilibria

- If we want predictive power, we must use a refinement

- I use trembling-hand perfection


Main theorem: Modified First Welfare Theorem

  .center[Even with **incomplete and endogenous markets**,]
  .center[every perfect investment equilibrium is efficient.]

THP Equilibria Need Not Be Efficient
====================================

- Consider the following 2x2 game

.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_A.png)]

- (Up, Left) is the unique THP equilibrium

- Selten (1975)'s original, extensive-form example is inefficient


---
Price-Taking Solves Hold-up
====================================

- With a hold-up problem, sellers may worry she faces a buyer that is a very tough bargainer

- The transfer to seller may not cover investment cost: `\(p(1,1)&lt;\frac{1}{4}\)`

- In that case, sellers want to invest as little as possible

- Price-taking ensures `\(p(1,1) \in \left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]\)`

`\(\Rightarrow\)` each side wants to invest as much as possible
