@article{Scheuer2014,
abstract = {I analyze the optimal taxation of profits and labor income under endogenous firm formation. Individuals differ in their skill and cost of setting up a firm, and can become workers or entrepreneurs. A tax system in which profits and labor income are subject to the same schedule uses general equilibrium effects through wages to indirectly redistribute across occupations. Optimal policies can involve low tax rates at the top and distortions of firms' input choices. However, these properties disappear under a differential treatment of profits and labor income. Then, redistribution is achieved directly through taxes and production efficiency is always optimal. (JEL H21, H24, H25, J24, L25, L26)},

@article{Alonso2016PersuadingVoters,
abstract = {We consider a symmetric information voting model where a group of uninformed voters must collec-tively choose a policy. An individual (information controller) can influence voters' choices by designing the information content of a public signal. We characterize the controller's optimal signal, and how it varies with the electoral rules and the distribution of voters' preferences. We show that under a non-unanimous voting rule the controller can exploit voters' heterogeneity by designing a signal with realizations that target different winning coalitions. As a result, under simple majority voting rule, a majority of voters might be strictly worse off due to the controller's influence. We characterize voters' preferences over electoral rules in anticipation of the controller's influence. We provide conditions for a majority of voters to prefer a supermajority (or unanimity) voting rule, in order to induce the controller to supply a more informative signal.},

Even if the fundamentals are sound, fear of premature foreclosure by others may lead to pre-emptive action, undermining the project. Recognition of this problem lies behind corporate bankruptcy provisions across the world, and it has been identified as a culprit in international financial crises, but has received scant attention from the literature on debt pricing. Without common knowledge of fundamentals, the incidence of failure is uniquely determined provided that private information is precise enough. This affords a way to price the coordination failure. Comparative statics on the unique equilibrium provides several insights on the role of information and the incidence of inefficient liquidation. ? 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

With imperfect credit and insurance markets some redistributive policies can improve ex ante welfare, and this implies that their political support tends to decrease with inequality. Conversely, with credit constraints, lower redistribution translates into more persistent inequality; hence the potential for multiple steady states, with mutually reinforcing high inequality and low redistribution, or vice versa},

In agreement with Downs's rational ignorance hypothesis, individual investment in political information declines to zero as the number of voters increases.

Contracts are incomplete in the sense that the agents have private information at the time when decisions are made. Since the agent who owns an asset has the right to make a unilateral decision regarding this asset, ownership determines disagreement payo¤s, which in turn determine the attainable surplus. We {\ldots}nd that nonintegration (where each agent owns one asset) sometimes dominates integration (where one agent owns both assets) and vice versa. In particular, nonintegration is optimal if the gains from cooperation are large compared to the possible rents that can be extracted.

@article{Tyson2016InformationChoice,
abstract = {I develop a theory of strategic voting that captures an endogenous link between the costly decision to vote and the costly decision to become politically informed. I then use the theoretical model to study the effects of different public policy instruments on the incentives of voters to cast informed votes. I show that policies that directly target the cost of political engagement, by influencing either the cost of information acquisition or the cost associated with casting a vote, have an ambiguous effect on the overall level of informed voting, and thus have unclear welfare implications. I also show that compulsory voting provides an incentive for voters to acquire political information so as to ensure that the vote they are compelled to cast actually benefits them, which overall, increases the level of informed voting. V oting is one of the principal acts of civic engagement, but not all citizens choose to be engaged in this fashion. In an effort to improve the quality of democratic choice and promote civic engagement, some countries have imposed various policies designed to provide incentives for individuals to participate in electoral politics. Aside from legitimacy con-cerns, increasing the level of voter turnout in elections is beneficial only when the added votes are from individuals who know which political alternatives best represent their interests. For instance, the accountability of politicians relies on whether voters possess a sufficient level of political information to be able to sanction incumbents for poor performance, corruption, or incompetence. Put more succinctly, increased voting is only beneficial if it is informed voting. If increased voter turnout in elections is only beneficial whenever voters are informed, then the public policy ques-tion of how to improve the quality of democratic choice becomes a question of adopting policies that provide both the incentive to become politically informed and the in-centive to cast a vote. In general, there are two distinct types of public policies that might achieve these goals. First, public policies could directly target the acquisition of political in-formation in an effort to provide incentives for individuals to become politically informed anticipating that individuals, once informed, may be motivated to vote. Second, public policies could target the decision to vote. By providing an added incentive for an individual to cast a ballot, might that same individual be compelled to ensure that her vote will benefit her? Consider an example: suppose one policy platform will be tough on crime using a large portion of the public budget to hire more police. The other policy platform will use a large portion of the public budget to improve public parks. Some individuals prefer more police in any state of the world, while some individuals prefer improved parks in any state of the world—these are partisan voters. Independent voters prefer more police only in a high crime state of the world and prefer the public budget to be spent on improving parks only in a low crime state of the world. Independent voters are potentially pivotal in the contest between partisans; but the set of inde-pendent voters share a common value, which is contingent on the unknown level of crime. Now suppose that voters can, at some cost, acquire information about the true level of crime in their area. Even when political information is perfectly reliable, some individuals will choose not to purchase information and, consequently, cannot cast an informed vote. In addition, some voters may acquire information but then decide not to vote. The question becomes: what motivates individuals who are politically informed to use the information they have acquired to bring their political preferences to bear? How might public policy influence whether the preferences of independent voters are represented? To examine these questions theoretically requires a theory that endogenizes both the strategic decision to vote and the},

Agents are strategic in revealing their information, but the principal can verify an agent's information at a given cost. We exclude monetary transfers. When is it worthwhile for the principal to incur the cost and learn an agent's information? We characterize the mechanism that maximizes the expected utility of the principal. This mechanism can be implemented as a weighted majority voting rule, where agents are given additional weight if they provide evidence about their information. The evidence is verified whenever it is decisive for the principal's decision. Additionally, we find a general equivalence between Bayesian and ex-post incentive compatible mechanisms in this setting. In the last part of the paper we extend our analysis of optimal mechanisms to one version of imperfect verification.},

We document a 20 percent increase in dividend payments by nonfinancial, nonutility publicly traded corporations following the tax cut. An unusually large number of firms initiated or increased regular dividend payments in the year after the reform. As a result, the number of firms paying dividends began to increase in 2003 after a continuous decline for more than two decades. Firms with high levels of nontaxable institutional ownership did not change payout policies, supporting the causality of the tax cut in increasing aggregate dividend payments. The response to the tax cut was strongest in firms with strong principals whose tax incentives changed (those with large taxable institutional owners or independent directors with large share holdings), and in firms where agents had stronger incentives to respond (high share ownership and low options ownership among top executives). Hence, principal-agent issues appear to play an important role in corporate responses to taxation.},

@article{Albrecht2017a,
abstract = {In papers on the history of thought, writers often lump Adam Smith and F. A. Hayek together. Both Smith and Hayek are classical liberal, free-market economists. Each emphasized the spontaneous order that develops without any person planning the order. They also discuss the benefits of such spontaneous orders. Yet, as with any two great thinkers, Smith and Hayek had important differences. This paper adds to the literature by clarifying one such difference. Smith believes that on some margins, particularly education, ends that are not achieved through the spontaneous order should be promoted by governmental action. Hayek is skeptical of the ability and benefit of picking particular ends to promote through government intervention. For Hayek, the beneficial attribute of a spontaneous order is its general application.},

@book{Smith2006AdamPhilosophy,

Adam Smith's Political Philosophy makes visible the invisible hand by examining its significance in Smith's political philosophy and relating it to similar concepts used by other philosophers, revealing a distinctive approach to social theory that stresses the significance of the unintended consequences of human action. This book introduces greater conceptual clarity to the discussion of the invisible hand and the related concept of unintended order in the work of Smith and in political theory more generally. By examining the application of spontaneous order ideas in the work of Smith, Hume, Hayek and Popper, Adam Smith's Political Philosophy traces similarities in approach and from these builds a conceptual, composite model of an invisible hand argument. While setting out a clear model of the idea of spontaneous order the book also builds the case for using the idea of spontaneous order as an explanatory social theory, with chapters on its application in the fields of science, moral philosophy, law and government.},

There are large differences in the frequency with which students from seemingly similar schools reach high achievement levels. The distribution of unexplained school effects includes a thick tail of schools that produce many more ­high-achieving students than is typical. Several additional analyses suggest that the differences are not primarily due to unobserved differences in student characteristics. The differences are persistent across time, suggesting that differences in the effectiveness of educational programs are not primarily due to direct peer effects. (JEL H75, I21, I24, I28, R23)},
annote = {From Duplicate 1 (Do schools matter for high math achievement? Evidence from the American Mathematics Competitions - Ellison, Glenn; Swanson, Ashley)

Use American Math Competition to see if schools are important for the high performances. The benefit of the data is that it looks at very deep knowledge, compared to say the SAT. However, it is a non-random sample. Only 100,000 students take the exam. The schools are match to census data, ACT, etc. I don't see why the students aren't.

The data looks at public, coed, non-magnet, non-charter schools. The author argues this should bias downward the estimate, since they are dropping the schools that would seem most likely to help high math achievers.


Take away: some schools produce many more high scorers than schools with similar demographics, using a negative bionomial regression http://assets.cambridge.org/97805211/98158/frontmatter/9780521198158{\_}frontmatter.pdf.  This seems to remain controlling for average SAT score, hinting that it might not be purely peer effects.},

abstract = {I study a mechanism design problem of allocating a single good to one of several agents. The mechanism is followed by an aftermarket, that is, a post-mechanism game played between the agent who acquired the good and third-party market participants. The designer has preferences over final outcomes, but she cannot redesign the aftermarket. However, she can influence its information structure by disclosing information elicited by the mechanism. I introduce a class of allocation and disclosure rules, called cutoff rules, that disclose information about the buyer's type only by revealing information about the random threshold (cutoff) that she had to outbid to win the object. A rule is implementable regardless of the form of the aftermarket and the underlying distribution of types if and only if it is a cutoff rule. Cutoff mechanisms are tractable, and admit an indirect implementation that often makes them easy to use in practice. I provide sufficient conditions for particularly simple designs, such as a second-price auction with disclosure of the price, to be optimal within the class of cutoff mechanisms. The theory is illustrated with an application to the design of trading rules and post-transaction transparency in financial over-the-counter markets.},

@book{Stringham2015PrivateLife,
abstract = {From the first stock markets of Amsterdam,London, and New York to the billions of electronic commerce transactions today, privately produced and enforced economic regulations are more common, more effective, and more promising than commonly considered. In Private Governance, prominent economist Edward Stringham presents case studies of the various forms of private enforcement, self-governance, or self-regulation among private groups or individuals that fill a void that government enforcement cannot. Through analytical narratives the book provides a close examination of the world's first stock markets, key elements of which were unenforceable by law; the community of Celebration, Florida, and other private communities that show how public goods can be bundled with land and provided more effectively; and the millions of credit-card transactions that occur daily and are regulated by private governance. Private Governance ultimately argues that while potential problems of private governance, such as fraud, are pervasive, so are the solutions it presents, and that much of what is orderly in the economy can be attributed to private groups and individuals. With meticulous research, Stringham demonstrates that private governance is a far more common source of order than most people realize, and that private parties have incentives to devise different mechanisms for eliminating unwanted behavior. Private Governance documents numerous examples of private order throughout history to illustrate how private governance is more resilient to internal and external pressure than is commonly believed. Stringham discusses why private governance has economic and social advantages over relying on government regulations and laws, and explores the different mechanisms that enable private governance, including sorting, reputation, assurance, and other bonding mechanisms. Challenging and rigorously-written, Private Governance will make a compelling read for those with an interest in economics, political philosophy, and the history of current Wall Street regulations.},

In this paper, we illustrate the effects of two general institutional features: separation of powers, which is common in presidential—congressional political systems, and legislative cohe-sion, which is typical of parliamentary systems. Compared to a simple legislative game, separation of powers brings about a smaller size of government and lower waste. Legislative cohesion induces a more equal distribution, but more waste and higher taxes, than separation of powers.},

abstract = {Most dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models of the macroeconomy assume that labor is traded in a spot market. Two exceptions by David Andolfatto and Monika Merz combine a two-sided search model with a one-sector real business cycle model. These hybrid models are successful, in some dimensions, but they cannot account for observed volatility in unemployment and vacancies. Following suggestions by Robert Hall and Robert Shimer, this paper shows that a relatively standard DSGE model with sticky wages can account for these facts. Using a second-order approximation to the policy function we simulate moments of an artificial economy with and without sticky wages and we document the dependence of unemployment and vacancy volatility on two key parameters; the disutility of effort and the degree of wage stickiness. We compute the welfare costs of the sticky wage equilibrium and find them to be small.},

The goal of this paper is to shed light on the foundations of modern American public finance by analysing one aspect of the methodology of its two most prominent fathers. I show (1) that it is difficult to distinguish Musgrave's and Buchanan's theories of public goods along the positive/normative dividing line and (2) that Buchanan's theory can also be considered normative. In the first three parts, I follow the Weberian methodological tradition in looking for value judgements in the theories, and by reflecting on the nature of ideal types. In the last part, I propose a broader interpretation of Buchanan's methodological stance within the academic context of the 1960s.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.A Lotto game is a two-person zero-sum game where each player chooses a distribution on nonnegative real numbers with given expectation, so as to maximize the probability that his realized choice is higher than his opponent's. These games arise in various competitive allocation setups (e.g., contests, research and development races, political campaigns, Colonel Blotto games). A Captain Lotto game is a Lotto game with caps, which are upper bounds on the numbers that may be chosen. First, we solve the Captain Lotto games. Second, we show how to reduce all-pay auctions to simpler games—expenditure games—using the solution of the corresponding Lotto games. As a particular application we solve all-pay auctions with unequal caps, which may yield a significant increase in the seller's revenue (or, the players' efforts).},

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions to obtain either a non-increasing-mean or a non-decreasing-mean spread of actions whenever information precision increases for at least one agent. We apply our Bayesian comparative statics framework to study informational exter-nalities in strategic environments. In persuasion games, we derive sufficient conditions that lead to extremal disclosure of information. In oligopolistic markets, we characterize the incentives of firms to share information. In macroeconomic models, we show that information not only drives the amplitude of business cycles but also affects aggregate output.

All information is publicly held and common knowledge, and there is a complete set of contingent claims markets. Since there is complete information, an agent cannot enter into a contract in which he would have an incentive to default in some state.

While the roles of the first two cultures can be outlined, the basis for Iroquois participa- tion, i.e., their desire for wampum, is incompletely understood. Using sources from archeology, history, ethnohistory, ethnography, economics, and anthropological theory, ten cultural factors are presented which explain the high esteem given wampum by the Iroquois. The last and most complex argument ties mythological accounts of wampum's origins to social, economic, political, and ideational process, that is, to the evolution of the Iroquois League. The study represents a multidisciplinary approach to artifact analysis, and is a case study of the role of shell beads in culture change.},

A policy will be reformed ex post if a large enough coalition of citizens supports reform; thus, sustainable policies are those that will continue to attract enough political support in the future. We find that optimal marginal capital taxes are either pro-gressive or U-shaped, so that savings are subsidized for the poor and/or the middle class but are taxed for the rich. U-shaped capital taxes always emerge when individuals' political behavior is purely determined by economic motives. (JEL D12, D14, D31, D72, H21, H25) It is a historical fact that welfare-state construction has depended on political coalition-building. —G{\o}sta Esping-Andersen (1990) A fundamental observation in political economy is that high levels of economic inequality may lead to political instability. Most famously, Marx predicted that an increase in the concentration of capital would lead to a political revolution and rad-ical redistribution, a concern recently revived by Piketty (2014). 1 In this paper, we consider a course of public policy—as well as the resulting economic inequality—to be politically sustainable if and only if it maintains the support of a coalition of citizens that is large enough to block reform in the future. We then ask what is the optimal politically sustainable capital tax policy. As the Esping-Andersen quotation indicates, dynamic tax policy and politi-cal coalition formation have been intertwined since the very origin of the modern 1 " {\ldots}there is no ineluctable force standing in the way of a return to extreme concentration of wealth{\ldots} If this were to happen, I believe that it would lead to significant political upheaval " (Piketty 2014, p. 422) .},

@article{Horwitz2001FromTradition,
abstract = {L ately, thinkers from both the political left and the political right have increas-ingly been making critical comments about the Enlightenment and the politi-cal liberalism normally associated with it. Many of these criticisms center around the concern that the tradition of Enlightenment liberalism portrays human beings as hyperrational or extremely atomized. The critics deem the view of knowledge and social interaction they associate with Enlightenment liberalism to be out of touch with more recent conceptions of human agency and community. Such criticisms, how-ever, tend to conflate the various strands of Enlightenment liberalism. In particular, the critics have too little awareness of the work of thinkers associated with the liberal tradi-tion emerging out of the Scottish Enlightenment. The differences between the Scot-tish variant of Enlightenment liberalism and the English and French versions render the Scottish version more immune to some of these criticisms. Specifically, the Scottish tradition's emphasis on spontaneous order and its conception of market exchange as a form of communication give it a distinct approach worth exploring. 1},

The model fits very well a number of empirical observations, including the observed wealth distribution for entrepreneurs and workers. At the aggregate level, more restrictive borrowing constraints generate less wealth concentration and reduce average firm size, aggregate capital, and the fraction of entrepreneurs. Voluntary bequests allow some high‐ability workers to establish or enlarge an entrepreneurial activity. With accidental bequests only, there would be fewer very large firms and less aggregate capital and wealth concentration.},

Whether the power to tax should be restricted, and if so how, are issues of immediate policy significance. Providing a serious analysis of these issues, the authors of this 1980 book offer an approach to the understanding and evaluation of the fiscal system, one that yields profound implications. The central question becomes: how much 'power to tax' would the citizen voluntarily grant to government as a party to some initial social contract devising a fiscal constitution? Those in office are assumed to exploit the power assigned to them to the maximum possible extent: government is modelled as 'revenue-maximizing Leviathan'. Armed with such a model, the authors proceed to trace out the restrictions on the power to tax that might be expected to emerge from the citizen's constitutional deliberations.},

@article{Klein2009a,
abstract = {We tell of the evolving meaning of the term coordination as used by economists. The paper is based on systematic electronic searches (on "coord," etc.) of major works and leading journals. The term coordination first emerged in professional economics around 1880, to describe the directed productive concatenation of factors or activities within a firm. Also, transportation economists used the term to describe the concatenation of routes and trips of a transportation system. These usages represent what we term concatenate coordination. The next major development came in the 1930s from several LSE economists (Hayek, Plant, Hutt, and Coase), who extended that concept beyond the eye of any actual coordinator. That is, they wrote of the concatenate coordination of a system of polycentric or spontaneous activities. These various applications of concatenate coordination prevailed until the next major development, namely, Thomas Schelling and game models. Here coordination referred to a mutual meshing of actions. Game theorists developed crisp ideas of coordination games (like "battle of the sexes"), coordination equilibria, convention, and path dependence. This "coordination" was not a refashioning, but rather a distinct concept, one we distinguish as mutual coordination. As game models became more familiar to economists, it was mutual coordination that economists increasingly had in mind when they spoke of "coordination." Economists switched, so to speak, to a new semantic equilibrium. Now, mutual coordination overshadows the older notion of concatenate coordination. The two senses of coordination are conceptually distinct and correspond neatly to the two dictionary definitions of the verb to coordinate. Both are crucial to economics. We suggest that distinguishing between the two senses can help to clarify "coordination" talk. Also, compared to talk of "efficiency" and "optimality," concatenate coordination allows for a richer, more humanistic, and more openly aesthetic discussion of social affairs. The narrative is backed up by Excel worksheets that report on systematic content searches of the writings of economics using the worldwide web and, using JSTOR, of Quarterly Journal of Economics, Economic Journal, Journal of Political Economy, American Economic Review, and Economica. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To this goal, we limit the communication that is embedded in a neoclassical economy by allowing trading to be random and decentral-ized. We then show that the business cycle may be driven by a certain type of extrinsic shocks which we call sentiments. These shocks formalize shifts in expectations of eco-nomic activity without shifts in the underlying preferences and technologies; they are akin to sunspots, but operate in unique-equilibrium models. We further show how com-munication may help propagate these shocks in a way that resembles the spread of fads and rumors and that gives rise to boom-and-bust phenomena. We finally illustrate the quantitative potential of our insights within a variant of the RBC model.},

@article{Harsanyi1969,
abstract = {In a recent study, Buekers, Magill, and Hall (1992) showed that even when verbal knowledge of results (KR) was redundant with sensory feedback, erroneous KR influenced the learning of motor skills. To determine why this occurred, we conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1, subjects performed 50 practice trials on a complex anticipation task and then performed three non-KR retention tests of 25 trials each. The results indicated that when correct KR and erroneous KR were provided alternately, subjects ignored the erroneous KR and performed according to the correct KR. Experiment 2 compared different ratios of no KR to erroneous KR. The results showed that, for low ratios (1:1 and 4:1), learning experience was similar to a condition in which erroneous KR was presented on all trials. For a higher ratio (9:1), however, learning performance was similar to performance when KR was correct on all trials or was not presented. These results are interpreted as support for the hypothesis that when two conflicting sources of information are available, the subject's degree of uncertainty about the valid source of information influences his selection of the information to guide performance},

abstract = {We develop a framework for optimal taxation when agents can earn their income both in traditional activities, where private and social products coincide, and in rent-seeking activities, where private returns exceed social returns either because they involve the capture of pre-existing rents or because they reduce the returns to traditional work. We characterize Pareto optimal income taxes that do not condition on how much of an individual's income is earned in each of the two activities. These optimal taxes feature an externality-corrective term, the magnitude of which depends both on the Pigouvian correction that would obtain if rent-seeking incomes could be perfectly targeted and on the relative impact of rent-seeking externalities on the private returns to traditional and to rent-seeking activities. If rent-seeking externalities primarily affect other rent-seekers, for example, the optimal correction lies strictly below the Pigouvian correction. A calibrated model indicates that the gap between the Pigouvian and optimal correction can be quantitatively important. Our results thus point to a hefty informational requirement for correcting rent-seeking externalities through the income tax code.},

@article{Hendrickson2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 A growing body of research highlights the correlation between strong, centralized states and economic growth. Given the important role that national defense has played in the development of the state, it seems as though this would imply some relationship between military expenditures and economic development. However, there is no consensus on the direction of the relationship between military expenditures and economic growth. In this paper, we propose a resolution to this puzzle. We argue that military technology is a limiting factor for wealth (and therefore capital) accumulation. Since wealth must be protected from plunder and/or destruction, the amount of wealth that can be accumulated is constrained by a society's ability to adequately defend it. We present a theoretical model consistent with this idea and perform a Monte Carlo experiment to determine the implications of this hypothesis for empirical work. We find that the long-run relationship between military expenditures and private production is positive. However, in sample sizes consistent with existing data, the relationship is ambiguous. As a result, we provide support for this idea by relying on historical examples consistent with our hypothesis. Finally, we consider the implications of our hypothesis for the development of state capacity.},

I generalize the standard model to accommodate this preference for a mixed objective, proposing a method by which to make disparate criteria commensurable while respecting Pareto efficiency. Then, I show that optimal policy in this generalized model, calibrated to the survey evidence and U.S. microdata, is capable of quantitatively matching several features of existing tax policy that are incompatible in the conventional model but widely endorsed in the survey and reality, including the coexistence of substantial redistribution and limited tagging.

abstract = {Hayek is known primarily as an economic theorist and classical liberal political economist. A few scholars have delved deeply into the connection between Hayek's analytical contributions to economics and his visionary political economy of liberalism, but most prefer to divide Hayek's career into two distinct stages: an early stage as an economist primarily concerned with monetary theory and business fluctuations, and a later stage as a social theorist concerned with the critique of socialism and the advocacy of classical liberalism. It is not my purpose to counter this argument in this chapter with an argument for unity in the corpus of Hayek's work. Instead, what I want to emphasize is not so much his analytical unity (which I do believe is largely present), but an attitudinal unity with regard to the way one makes an argument in politics, philosophy, and economics. Throughout his career, Hayek possessed a profound respect for the intellectual history of the various disciplines within which he chose to write. He read far into the past of the discipline in order to place contemporary disputes in context and to borrow from older ideas in order to make innovative contribution. For Hayek, saying something old often represented saying something extremely fresh and new. Hayek was part of a generation of economists who believed that knowledge of history of the discipline was not simply an antiquarian interest, but a vital component of the education and training of any economist.},

abstract = {The notion of plan coordination enjoys a central place in the analysis of institutions and competitive market processes. The conventional wisdom is that institutions and policies vary in the extent to which they promote competition and how quickly and completely they bring individuals' plans into closer coordination with one another. Kirzner has provided the most fully elaborated statement on the use of coordination as a positive analytical device for explaining market dynamics and as a normative criterion for evaluating economic policies. We identify the core propositions in his analysis that elucidate how economic coordination depends upon that most fundamental of market institutions - the system of private property rights. We also probe into Kirzner's claims about inherent limitations in our ability to compare the coordinative potential of alternative property rights systems. We unpack the consequences of these core propositions using the economic theory of property rights. We also examine Kirzner's assertion that dynamic competition - including Schumpeterian innovation - is necessarily coordinative in its market effects. We find that his argument rests on the implicit assumption that property rights remain constant during the process of market adjustment. We provide a case study of the advent of commercial aviation as a potential counterexample to his claims. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this game model, each candidate generates offers for voters independently out of a distribution that is chosen by the candidate, subject only to the constraints that offers must be nonnegative and have mean 1. Symmetric equilibria with sincere voting are analyzed for two-candidate elections and for multicandidate elections under rank-scoring rules, approval voting, and single transferable vote. Voting rules that can guarantee representation for minorities in multiseat elections generate, in this model, the most severely unequal campaign promises.},

The laaer is an admissible extensive form, in which there is a random-ization device that not only sends (private) recommendations to the agents, but also selects the order in which the agents move; moreover, subsequent recommendations can be made conditional on actions already taken.

ABSTRACT This paper models social distance as endogenous to the choices of individuals. I show how large numbers of socially heterogeneous agents can use signals that reduce social distance to capture the gains from widespread trade. Although traditional reputational mechanisms of multilateral punishment break down where large populations of socially diverse agents are involved, ex ante signaling can make widespread trade self-enforcing. Intergroup trade in precolonial Africa provides evidence for this mechanism.},

We study the role of information in crises by introducing a financial market in a coordination game with imperfect information. The asset price aggregates dispersed private information acting as a public noisy signal. In contrast to the case with exogenous information, our main result is that uniqueness may not obtain as a perturbation from perfect information: multiplicity is ensured with small noise. In addition, we show that: (a) multiplicity may emerge in the financial price itself; (b) less noise may contribute toward nonfundamental volatility even when the equilibrium is unique; and (c) similar results obtain for a model where individuals observe one another's actions, highlighting the importance of endogenous information more generally.

@article{Forges2006CorrelatedRevisited,
abstract = {A mistake in "Five legitimate definitions of correlated equilibrium (CE) in games with incomplete information" motivates a re-examination of some extensions of the solution concept that Aumann introduced (1974, 1987). As argued in 1993 in Forges (see record 1994-24184-001), the agent normal form CE can be viewed as an expression of Bayesian rationality, but this property characterizes a larger set of solutions. The non-equivalence of the belief invariant Bayesian solution and the agent normal form CE, as well as recent research on related topics, calls for a careful re-interpretation of both solution concepts. The definitions of CE in games with incomplete information and Lehrer et al.'s (2006) counterexample is recalled. Then, it is shown that many differences between the extensions of the CE disappear in a standard cheap talk extension of the game, which does not affect the communication equilibrium outcomes nor the Bayesian solutions. Roughly, only the latter two solution concepts need to be considered if the number of players is at least three. In particular, the equivalence claimed in Forges can be recovered in that framework.

abstract = {The standard neoclassical approach to economic theorising excludes, by definition, economic emergence and the related phenomenon of entrepreneurship. We explore how the most economic of human behaviours, entrepreneurship, came to be largely excluded from mainstream economic theory. In contrast, we report that evolutionary economists have acknowledged the importance of understanding emergence and we explore the advances that have been made in this regard. We go on to argue that evolutionary economics can make further progress by taking a more 'naturalistic' approach to economic evolution. This requires that economic analysis be fully embedded in complex economic system theory and that associated understandings as to how humans react to states of uncertainty be explicitly dealt with. We argue that 'knowledge,' because of the existence of uncertainty is, to a large degree 'conjectural' and, thus, is closely linked to our emotional states. Our economic behaviour is also influenced by the reality that we, and the systems that we create, are dissipative structures. Thus, we introduce the notions of 'energy gradients' and 'knowledge gradients' as essential concepts in understanding economic emergence and resultant economic growth. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

Significant relationships are found.

abstract = {Over time, there has been a tendency for political jurisdictions and residents to converge on a single currency. Monopoly over seigniorage is a source of political power and a valuable lifeline when sovereignty is threatened. Moreover a uniform currency, insofar as it is free of counterparty and liquidity risk, facilitates economic activity. But will digital currencies now reverse this trend toward uniformity, given the apparent ease with which they can be created? The information sensitivity of those units, evident in the fact that they trade at varying prices, suggests that they do not yet provide the core functions of money. So-called stable coins are intended to bridge this gap, but whether they can be successfully scaled up and maintain their stability is doubtful. The one unit that can clearly meet these challenges is central bank digital currency. But there would be both costs and benefits of moving in this direction.},

Using non-parametric methods, we show that the growth rate is an inverted U-shaped function of net changes in inequality: changes in inequality (in any direction) are associated with reduced growth in the next period. The estimated relationship is robust to variations in control variables and estimation methods. This inverted U-curve is consistent with a simple political economy model but it could also re¯ect the nature of measurement errors, and, in general, efforts to interpret this evidence causally run into dif{\textregistered}cult identi{\textregistered}cation problems.

abstract = {This paper investigates pure strategy sequential equilibria of repeated games with imperfect monitoring. The approach emphasizes the equilibrium value set and the static optimization problems embedded in extremal equilibria. A succession of propositions, central among which is "self-generation," allow properties of constrained efficient supergame equilibria to be deduced from the solutions of the static problems. We show that the latter include solutions having a "bang-bang" property; this affords a significant simplification of the equilibria that need be considered. These results apply to a broad class of asymmetric games, thereby generalizing our earlier work on optimal cartel equilibria. The bang-bang theorem is strengthened to a necessity result: under certain conditions, efficient sequential equilibria have the property that after every history, the value to players of the remainder of the equilibrium must be an extreme point of the equilibrium value set. General implications of the self-generation and bang-bang propositions include a proof of the monotonicity of the equilibrium average value set in the discount factor, and an iterative procedure for computing the value set.},

@book{Gaus2016,
abstract = {In his provocative new book, The Tyranny of the Ideal, Gerald Gaus lays out a vision for how we should theorize about justice in a diverse society. Gaus shows how free and equal people, faced with intractable struggles and irreconcilable conflicts, might share a common moral life shaped by a just framework. He argues that if we are to take diversity seriously and if moral inquiry is sincere about shaping the world, then the pursuit of idealized and perfect theories of justice--essentially, the entire production of theories of justice that has dominated political philosophy for the past forty years--needs to change.

Drawing on recent work in social science and philosophy, Gaus points to an important paradox: only those in a heterogeneous society--with its various religious, moral, and political perspectives--have a reasonable hope of understanding what an ideally just society would be like. However, due to its very nature, this world could never be collectively devoted to any single ideal. Gaus defends the moral constitution of this pluralistic, open society, where the very clash and disagreement of ideals spurs all to better understand what their personal ideals of justice happen to be.

Presenting an original framework for how we should think about morality, The Tyranny of the Ideal rigorously analyzes a theory of ideal justice more suitable for contemporary times.},

In an environment where the Revelation Principle fails, and hence direct manipulation of players' beliefs is indispensable, we use our re-sults to compute the optimal solution.

In volume 2, the author examines the theories of utilitariansim and legal positivism and considers the concept of 'social justice.' He shows this ideal to be devoid of meaning and therefore a most harmful and dangerous cause of the mis-direction of well-meant efforts: he demonstrates that it is a remnant of the tribal ethics of a closed society and whooly incompatible with the individual freedom whih the Open Society promises. In the final volume, Hayek analyses and discards modern sociobiological theories of morality and social conduct, demonstrating that man's behaviour pattern has been determined more by custom than by the exercise of reason, and that mind and culture therefore developed concurrently and not successively. He shows how the democratic ideal is in danger of miscarrying due to the erroneous assumptions that there can be moral standards without moral discipline, that the element of tradition can be ignored in proposals for restructuring society, and the way in which the disctinct ideals of egalitarianism and democracy are increasingly confused.},

In such rediscovery, a memorandum that Samuelsom wrote in 1951 for the us Treasury became central. I examine Samuelson's account and challenge it in some respects and explore the historical context of the emergence of the optimal taxation literature in the 1970s.

If sellers are systematically poorer than buyers, for example, they will be willing to sell at relatively low prices. Yet a designer who cares about inequality might prefer to set higher prices precisely when sellers are poor – effectively, using the market as a redistributive tool. In this paper, we seek to understand how to design goods markets optimally in the presence of persistent inequality. Using a mechanism design approach, we find that redistribution through markets can indeed be optimal. When there is substantial inequality across sides of the market, the designer uses a tax-like mechanism, intro-ducing a wedge between the buyer and seller prices, and redistributing the resulting surplus to the poorer side of the market via lump-sum payments. When there is signifi-cant within-side inequality, meanwhile, the designer imposes price controls even though doing so induces rationing.},

The swing voter's curse leads to the equilibrium result that a sub-stantial fraction of the electorate will abstain even though all abstainers strictly prefer voting for one candidate over voting for another. (JEL D72) In the 1994 state of Illinois elections there were 6,119,001 registered voters. Among those registered to vote only 3,106,566 voted in the gubernatorial race and only 2,144,200 voted on a proposed amendment to the state constitution.' There is nothing exceptional},

abstract = {This paper reexamines the effect of expansionary fiscal policy on real GDP in the presence of entrepreneurship when government expenditure partially crowds out private consumption. As government expenditure cannot reflect changes in consumers' tastes, expansionary fiscal policy weakens the social role of firms' activities to predict and adapt to idiosyncratic changes in consumers' taste. I show that expansionary fiscal policy can lower real GDP when idiosyncratic risk and the substitutability of goods are large and when firms have a strong ability to predict changes in consumer tastes. I also investigate how expansionary fiscal policy influences firms' investments in prediction ability. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we show that, as long as the population is finite and agents are sufficiently patient, a social norm establishing gift-exchange can substitute for money. However, for a given discount factor, population growth eventually leads to the breakdown of the social norm. Additionally, increases in the degree of specialization in the economy can also undermine the social norm. By contrast, monetary equilibrium exists independent of the population size. We conclude that money is essential as a medium of exchange when the population is large. ? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Our review contains two parts. We first discuss motives for government intervention in private insurance markets, focusing primarily on selection. We review the original theoretical arguments for government intervention in the presence of adverse selection, and describe how recent work has refined and challenged the conclusions drawn from early theoretical models. We then describe empirical work that tests for selection in insurance markets, documents the welfare costs of this selection, and analyzes the welfare consequences of potential public policy interventions. In the second part of the paper, we review work on optimal social insurance policies. We discuss formulas for the optimal level of insurance benefits in terms of empirically estimable parameters. We then consider the consequences of relaxing the key assumptions underlying these formulas, e.g., by allowing for fiscal externalities or behavioral biases. We also summarize recent work on other dimensions of optimal policy, including mandated savings accounts and the optimal path of benefits. Finally, we discuss the key challenges that remain in understanding the optimal design of social insurance policies. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Without third party enforcement, the vast majority of trades are initiated with private offers and the parties share the gains from trade equally. Low effort or bad quality is penalized by the termination of the relationship, wielding a powerful effect on contract enforcement. Successful long-term relations exhibit generous rent sharing and high effort (quality) from the very beginning of the relationship. In the absence of third-party enforcement, markets resemble a collection of bilateral trading islands rather than a competitive market. If contracts are third party enforceable, rent sharing and long-term relations are absent and the vast majority of trades are initiated with public offers. Most trades take place in one-shot transactions and the contracting parties are indifferent with regard to the identity of their trading partner. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The assignment model was the subject of the first application, after Edgeworth (1881), of the core to an economic model (Shapley, 1955); and a close relative of the assignment model, the transportation problem, was the subject of one of the earliest developments in linear programming (Kantorovich, 1942).

They propose rational criteria for selecting one particular uniformly perfect equilibrium point as the solution of any noncooperative game. And, because any cooperative game can be remodelled as a noncooperative bargaining game, their theory defines a one-point solution for any cooperative game as well. By providing solutions - based on the same principles of rational behavior - for all classes of games, both cooperative and noncooperative, both those with complete and with incomplete information, Harsanyi and Selten's approach achieves a remarkable degree of theoretical unification for game theory as a whole and provides a deeper insight into the nature of game-theoretic rationality. The book applies this theory to a number of specific game classes, such as unanimity games; bargaining with transaction costs; trade involving one seller and several buyers; two-person bargaining with incomplete information on one side, and on both sides. The last chapter discusses the relationship of the authors' theory to other recently proposed solution concepts, particularly the Kohberg-Mertens stability theory.},

Building on theoretical insights from Carlsson and van Damme (1993), it explores the effect of small amounts of private information on a class of dynamic cooperation games with exit. Lack of common knowledge leads players to second guess each other's behavior and makes coordination difficult. This restricts the range of equilibria and highlights the role of miscoordination payoffs in determining whether cooperation is sustainable or not. The paper characterizes the range of per- fect Bayesian equilibria as the players' information becomes arbitrarily precise.

This article argues that economists' use of the positive-normative distinction developed from the Mill–Keynes methodological tradition, which did not hold logical positivist views. Instead, it had pragmatic purposes and was designed to encourage economists to be more modest in their claims for the implications of economic theory.

We consider the optimal progressivity of earnings taxation and whether capital income should be taxed. We critically discuss the academic research on these topics and when and how the results can be used for policy recommendations. We argue that a result from basic research is relevant for policy only if 1) it is based on economic mechanisms that are empirically relevant and first order to the problem, 2) it is reasonably robust to changes in the modeling assumptions, and 3) the policy prescription is implementable (i.e, is socially acceptable and not too complex). We obtain three policy recommendations from basic research that satisfy these criteria reasonably well. First, very high earners should be subject to high and rising marginal tax rates on earnings. Second, low-income families should be encouraged to work with earnings subsidies, which should then be phased-out with high implicit marginal tax rates. Third, capital income should be taxed. We explain why the famous zero marginal tax rate result for the top earner in the Mirrlees model and the zero capital income tax rate results of Chamley and Judd, and Atkinson and Stiglitz are not policy relevant in our view.},

Some accounts suggest that models may afford understanding by providing causal knowledge about phenomena via how-possibly explanations. However, general equilibrium models, for example, pose a challenge to this solution since their contribution appears to be purely mathematical results. Despite this, practitioners widely acknowledge that it improves our understanding of the world. I argue that the Arrow–Debreu model provides a mathematical how-possibly explanation which establishes claims of mathematical dependence.

We first show that when the government does not observe the sectoral choice or underlying skills of its citizens, the constrained Pareto frontier can be implemented with a single nonlinear income tax. We then characterize this optimal tax schedule. If sectoral inputs are complements, a many-sector model with self-selection leads to optimal income taxes that are less progressive than the corresponding taxes in a standard single-sector model under natural conditions. However, they are more progressive than in canonical multisector economies with discrete types and without occupational choice or overlapping sectoral wage distributions.

Firstly, a team's organization is defined as an allocation of (public or private) commodities together with incentive compatible actions and information to its members. Secondly, a version of price taking equilibrium is proposed to formal-ize the idea that individuals compete to play games, and that both the games being played as well as the (incentive compatible) outcome of those games are determined competitively. This yields a general equilibrium foundation for efficient correlated equilibrium. Finally, our approach is contrasted with the recent theory of clubs, with emphasis on differences in the nature of prices for team versus club membership that lead to incentive efficiency. Specifically, anonymous pricing of jobs within clubs fails to decentralize incentive efficient allocations in the presence of binding incentive constraints.},

The empirical results suggest that the nonpecuniary benefits of self-employment are substantial: Most entrepreneurs enter and persist in business despite the fact that they have both lower initial earnings and lower earnings growth than in paid employment, implying a median earnings differential of 35 percent for individuals in business for 10 years. The differential cannot be explained by the selection of low-ability employees into self-employment and is similar for three alternative measures of self-employment earnings and across industries. Furthermore, the estimated earnings differentials may understate the differences in compensation across sectors since fringe benefits are not included in the measure of employee compensation},

abstract = {Most public goods are durable and have a significant dynamic component. In this paper, we report the results from a laboratory experiment designed explicitly to study the dynamics of free riding behavior in the accumulation of a durable public good that provides a stream of discounted benefits over a potentially infinite horizon. This dynamic free-rider problem differs from static ones in fundamental ways and implies several economically important predictions that are absent in static frameworks. We consider two cases: economies with reversibility (RIE), where the agents' voluntary contributions to the public good can be positive or negative; and economies with irreversibility (IIE), where contributions are nonnegative. For both economies, we characterize the unique Markov perfect equilibrium. The evidence supports the main predictions from the theory: behavior is generally consistent with stationary, forward-looking behavior; both in RIE and IIE the accumulation path is inefficiently slow and the public good under-provided; and RIE induces significantly higher public good contributions than IIE. A number of interesting deviations from the theoretical predictions are observed: both in RIE and in IIE we have over-investment in the early rounds of the game; in RIE over-investment is followed by periods in which negative contributions correct the stock, bringing it back to the predicted steady state; in IIE over-investment tends to decline approaching zero. To test the Markovian assumption, we compare the predictions of the Markov equilibrium with the prediction of the most efficient subgame perfect equilibrium and propose a novel experimental methodology that relies on the comparison between the behavior in the dynamic game and the behavior in a one-period reduced-form version of the dynamic game.},

This article examines a non-constant-sum version of the Colonel Blotto game that relaxes this use it or lose it feature.

Once the asymmetry of the players' budgets exceeds the threshold, this relationship breaks down and we construct a new equilibrium. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Optimal tax theory has shown that, under simple assumptions, indirect taxation such as production subsidies, tariffs, or differentiated commodity taxation, are sub-optimal and that redistribution should be achieved solely with the direct income tax. However, these important results of optimal tax theory, namely production efficiency and uniform commodity taxation under non-linear income taxation, have been shown to break down when labor taxation is based on income only and when there is imperfect substitution of labor types in the production function. These results in favor of indirect tax instruments are valid in the short-run when skills are exogenous and individuals cannot move from occupation to occupation. In the long-run, it is more realistic to assume that individuals choose their occupation based on the relative after-tax rewards. This paper shows that, in that context, production efficiency and the uniform commodity tax result are restored. Therefore, in a long-run context, direct income taxation should be preferred to indirect tax instruments to raise revenue and achieve redistribution. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Small groups are effective if all or almost all gains to collective activities can be realized by cooperation restricted to them. At this point, there are many papers in the literature demonstrating the competitiveness of club and coalition economies in a variety of contexts. To facilitate the exposition, I treat economies with quasi-linear utilities and games with side payments. The main concepts and results for this framework are discussed. Additionally, relationships are established with regard to broader models of club and coalition economies, including very recent contributions to the literature.},

@techreport{Buchanan2003PublicProgram,
abstract = {Public Choice: The Origins and Development of a Research Program 1 My subtitle identifies public choice as a research program rather than as a discipline or even a subdiscipline. (The Lakatosian definition seems to fit closely.) A research program incorporates acceptance of a hard core of presuppositions that impose limits on the domain of scientific inquiry while, at the same time, insulating such inquiry from essentially irrelevant criticism. The hard core in public choice can be summarized in three presuppositions: (1) methodological individualism, (2) rational choice, and (3) politics-as-exchange. The first two of these scientific building blocks are those that inform basic economics and will raise few criticisms from economists, although they become central in noneconomists' attacks on the whole enterprise. The third element in the hard core is less familiar, and I shall discuss this feature of public choice more fully later. Temporally, this research program involves a half century during which it originated, developed, and matured. Although there were precursors, some of whom will enter the narrative that follows, we can date the origins of public choice from midcentury. And this fact, in itself, is of considerable interest. Viewed retrospectively, from the vantage point of 2003, the scientific-explanatory " gap " that public choice emerged to fill seems so large that the development of the program seems to have been inevitable. As they emerged from World War II, governments, even in Western democracies, were allocating between one-third and one-half of their total product through collective-political institutions rather than through markets. Economists, however, were devoting their efforts almost exclusively to explanations-understandings of the market sector. No attention was being paid to political-collective decision making. Practitioners in political science were no better. They had developed no explanatory basis, no theory as it were, from which operationally falsifiable hypotheses might be derived.},

@article{Weeds2002,
abstract = {This paper considers irreversible investment in competing research projects with uncertain returns under a winner-takes-all patent system. Uncertainty takes two distinct forms: the technological success of the project is probabilistic, while the economic value of the patent to be won evolves stochastically over time. According to the theory of real options uncertainty generates an option value of delay, but with two competing firms the fear of preemption would appear to undermine this approach. In non-cooperative equilibrium two patterns of investment emerge depending on parameter values. In a pre-emptive leader-follower equilibrium firms invest sequentially and option values are reduced by competition. A symmetric outcome may also occur, however, in which investment is more delayed than the single-firm counterpart. Comparing this with the optimal cooperative investment pattern, investment is found to be more delayed when firms act non-cooperatively as each holds back from investing in the fear of starting a patent race. Implications of the analysis for empirical and policy issues in R{\&}D are considered.本文研究在“赢者通吃”的专利体系下，收益不确定的竞争性研究项目的不可逆投资。不确定性采用截然不同的两种形式：项目在技术上的成功是或然的，而获胜的专利的经济价值随时间随机变化。根据实物期权理论，不确定产生等待的期权价值，但是两个竞争的企业对于对手抢先投资的恐惧似乎会削弱这种方法。在非合作均衡处，投资的两种模式哪种会出现，取决于参数的值。在抢先投资的领先者-追随者均衡中，企业序列地投资，期权价值由于竞争而减少。然而，对称的结果也可能出现，在此情形中，投资比在单个企业的情形中更迟。将此与最优合作投资模式相比，由于对于引发专利竞赛的担心阻碍了企业的投资，所以当企业非合作地行动时，投资更迟。最后讨论了本研究对于企业研发的实证和政策问题的意义。},

Instead of relying on potentially prob-lematic theories of well-being to justify their choice of well-being measure, Daniel Hausman proposes that policy-makers can sometimes rely on preference-based mea-sures as evidence for well-being. I claim that Hausman's evidential account does not justify the use of any one measure more than it justifies the use of any other mea-sure. This leaves us at a loss as to which policy should be chosen in the non-trivial cases for which there is substantial disagreement between the different measures in their assessment of policy.},

Equilibrium investments and the equilibrium matching will be efficient if agents can simultaneously negotiate investments and matches, but we focus on markets in which agents must first sink their investments before matching. Additional equilibria may arise in this sunk-investment setting, even though our matching market is competitive. These equilibria exhibit inefficiencies that we can interpret as coordination failures. All allocations satisfying a constrained efficiency property are equilibria, and the converse holds if preferences satisfy a separability condition. We identify sufficient conditions (most notably, quasiconcave utilities) for the investments of matched agents to satisfy an exchange efficiency property as well as sufficient conditions (most notably, a single crossing property) for agents to be matched positive assortatively, with these conditions then forming the core of sufficient conditions for the efficiency of equilibrium allocations.},

@incollection{Nau1999ArbitrageBrains,
abstract = {Rational choice theory rests on the assumption that decision makers have complete mental models of the events, consequences and acts that constitute their environment. They are considered to be individually rational if they hold preferences among acts that satisfy axioms such as ordering and independence, and they are collectively rational if they satisfy additional postulates of inter-agent consistency such as common knowledge and common prior beliefs. It follows that rational decision makers are expected-utility maximizers who dwell in conditions of equilibrium. But real decision makers are only boundedly rational, they must cope with disequilibrium and environmental change, and their decision models are incomplete. As such, they are often unable or unwilling to behave in accordance with the rationality axioms, they find the theory hard to apply to most personal and organizational decisions, and they regard the theory's explanations of many economic and social phenomena to be unsatisfying. Models and experimental studies of bounded rationality, meanwhile, often focus on the behavior of unaided decision makers who employ strategies such as satisficing or adaptive learning that can be implemented with finite attention, memory, and computational ability. This essay proposes a new foundation for choice theory that does not rely on consequences, acts, and preferences as primitive concepts. Rather, agents articulate their beliefs and values through the acceptance of small gambles or trades in a stylized market. These primitive measurements are intersubjective in nature, eliminating the need for separate common knowledge assumptions, and they partly endogenize the writing of the “rules of the game.” In place of the assorted preference axioms and inter-agent consistency conditions of the standard theory, only a single axiom of substantive rationality is needed, namely the principle of no arbitrage. No-arbitrage is shown to be the primal characterization of rationality with respect to which solution concepts such as expected-utility maximization and strategic and competitive equilibria are merely dual characterizations. The traditional distinctions among individual, strategic, and competitive rationality are thereby dissolved. Arbitrage choice theory (ACT) does not require the decision models of individuals to be complete, so it is compatible with the notion that individual rationality is bounded. It is also inherently a theory of group rationality rather than individual rationality, so it can be applied at any level of activity from personal decisions to games of strategy to competive markets. This group-centered view of rationality admits the possibility that individuals do more than merely satisfice when making decisions in complex environments for which they lack complete models. Rather, they use “other people's brains” by seeking advice from colleagues and experts, forming teams or management hierarchies, consulting the relevant literature, relying on market prices, invoking social norms, and so on. The most important result of such interactive decision processes usually is not the identification of an existing alternative that optimizes the latent beliefs and values of the putative decision maker, but rather the synthesis of a more complete model of the problem than she (or perhaps anyone) initially possesses, the construction of sharper beliefs and values, and the discovery or creation of new (and perhaps dominant) alternatives. On this view, traditional models of rational choice that attempt to explain the behavior of households, firms, markets, and polities purely in terms of the satisfaction of individual preferences are perhaps overlooking the most important purpose of socioeconomic interactions, namely that they harness many people's brains to the solution of complex problems.},

abstract = {Correlated equilibrium is formulated in a manner that does away with the dichotomy usually perceived between the Bayesian and the game-theoretic view of the world. From the Bayesian viewpoint, probabilities should be assignable to everything, including the prospect of a player choosing a certain strategy in a certain game. The so-called game-theoretic viewpoint holds that probabilities can only be assigned to events not governed by rational decision makers; for the latter, one must substitute an equilibrium (or other game-theoretic) notion. The current formulation synthesizes the two viewpoints: Correlated equilibrium is viewed as the result of Bayesian rationality; the equilibrium condition appears as a simple maximization of utility on the part of each player, given his information. A feature of this approach is that it does not require explicit randomization on the part of the players. Each player always chooses a definite pure strategy,with no attempt to randomize; the probabilistic nature of the strategies reflects the uncertainty of other players about his choice.

abstract = {1 generally ignored factor in economic development has been the effect of international migration. This represents a glaring error when one considers the fact that in many countries the migration component is a major factor of demographic change. Another factor to consider is the influence that international migration is likely to have, in the long run, on certain regions where migration can be expected to develop, or dry up. Finally, over the medium term, international migration may come to constitute a major component of developmental strategies. The causes of migration are diverse, but generally it can be said that the pull exerted by a host country figures more prominently than the push of the country of origin in the decision to migrate. Evaluating the relative benefit of migration to the host country and to the country of origin is not a simple matter, and many interrelated factors must be considered. The relationship between international migration and economic development is likewise complex, but generally the positive aspects, for both host country and country of origin, outweigh the negative ones, at least in the short run. The long term prospects, however, are potentially considerably more negative. Conflicts which may arise between long and short term objectives are factors which must be dealt with in specifying a migration policy.},

abstract = {Tax policy is a product of politics, so a complete understanding of tax policy requires an explicit recognition of the political environment within which tax policy is made. The paper emphasizes the concept of political costs associated with the tax system and discusses several aspects of tax policy using a public choice approach. The paper argues that the political costs associated with taxation can be minimized by embedding the tax system within a relatively inflexible fiscal constitution. Despite the insights the public choice perspective offers, most analysis of tax policy does not take public choice considerations into account. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Imperfect memory makes money useful, but it also permits theft to go undetected, and therefore provides lucrative opportunities for thieves. Limited commitment constrains credit arrangements, and the constraints tend to tighten with imperfect memory, as this mitigates punishment for bad behavior in the credit market. Theft matters for optimal monetary policy, but at the optimum theft will not be observed in the model. The Friedman rule is in general not optimal with theft, and the optimal money growth rate tends to rise as the cost of theft falls. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Blankart2006PoliticalCompetition,
abstract = {Praise and blame have been poured on public choice in the fifty years of its existence. Some have welcomed the extension of economic analysis to govern-ment in that it allows analyzing public policy and markets consistently in one framework. Others, mainly political scientists, argue that the economic approach is carried too far and that it does not contribute much to an understanding of politics, while still others criticize that public-choice research-ers do not push the economic approach hard enough into politics. Among the latter are economists such as Alberto Alesina, Torsten Persson, and Guido Tabellini. In their opinion, not public choice but political economics is the right way to study politics from an economic perspective. In this paper we want to compare political economics and public choice. In particular, we want to investigate whether the public-choice paradigm has been replaced by a political-economics paradigm, as the proponents of the latter claim. We start in section II by characterizing public choice as well as political economics, each from the point of view of its adherents. In section III we compare and evaluate contributions of both approaches to an economic analysis of politics in three particular fields common to the two – political business cycles, integration and secession, and constitutional political econo-my. A general comparison of public choice and political economics as competing scientific paradigms will be presented in section IV. II THE PUBLIC-CHOICE PARADIGM AND ITS CHALLENGERS II.1 The Public-Choice Paradigm The adherents of public choice trace the core of their approach back to two basic insights into the organization of the state. The first is due to Kenneth J. Arrow (1951, 1963), who showed that the state cannot be seen in analogy to a person, because the aggregation of individual preferences into a collective ordering runs into basic consistency problems. The second comes from James M. Buchanan (1949, 1954), who stressed the importance of individual exchange for politics. The focus on exchange and not on coercion leads Buchanan to consensus among equals as benchmark for public decision-making. As real-world institutions and decisions generally deviate widely from this ideal, it becomes an important task for economists to offer a design for better institutions. The contributions of Duncan Black (1948) on the median-voter theorem, Gordon Tullock (1959) on logrolling, Anthony Downs (1957) on representa-tive democracy, Ronald Coase (1960) on social costs, and Mancur Olson (1965) on interest-group activity have to be seen in conjunction with the work of Arrow and Buchanan. They all laid the foundations for a school of thought that is known as public choice and to which nowadays a large family of researchers adhere 1},

There are multiple equilibria, which differ in the areas of circulation of the two currencies. In one equilibrium, the two national currencies are circulated only locally. In another, one currency is circulated as an international currency. There is also an equilibrium in which both currencies are accepted internationally. We also find an equilibrium in which the two currencies are directly exchanged. We first characterize the existence conditions of these equilibria in terms of the relative country size and the degree of economic integration and then use an evolutionary approach to equilibrium selection to explain the evolution of the international currency as the two economies become more integrated. Some welfare implications are also discussed. For example, a country can improve its national welfare by letting its own currency circulate internationally, provided the domestic circulation is controlled for. When the total supply is fixed, however, a resulting currency shortage may reduce the national welfare. 1.},

First, we rely on Harsanyi's (1967) model and represent the underlying multiperson decision problem as a fixed game with imperfect information. We survey four definitions of correlated equilibrium which have appeared in the literature. We show that these definitions are not equivalent to each other. We prove that one of them fits Aumann's framework; the 'agents normal form correlated equilibrium' is an expression of Bayesian rationality in games with incomplete information. We also follow a 'universal Bayesian approach' based on Mertens and Zamir's (1985) construction of the 'universal beliefs space'. Hierarchies of beliefs over independent variables (states of nature) and dependent variables (actions) are then constructed simultaneously. We establish that the universal set of Bayesian solutions satisfies another extension of Aumann's theorem. We get the following corollary: once the types of the players are not fixed by the model, the various definitions of correlated equilibrium previously considered are equivalent.},

These predictions are pre-cisely those provided by interim correlated rationalizability (ICR). This negative result is obtained under the assumption that agents have no information on payoffs. This as-sumption is unnatural in many settings. It is therefore natural to ask whether Weinstein and Yildiz's results remain true under more general information structures. This pa-per characterizes the " robust predictions " in static and dynamic games, under arbitrary information structures. This characterization is provided by an extensive form solution concept: interim sequential rationalizability (ISR). In static games, ISR coincides with ICR and does not depend on the assumptions on agents' information. Hence the " no information " assumption entails no loss of generality in these settings. This is not the case in dynamic games, where ISR refines ICR and depends on the details of the infor-mation structure. In these settings, the robust predictions depend on the assumptions on agents' information. This reveals a hitherto neglected interaction between informa-tion and higher order uncertainty, raising novel questions of robustness.},

Consider a world of traders separated in geographic, economic, or social space. Honest trade offers larger gains for more distant traders, but frequencies of meetings, and information flows about cheating, have local bias. Honesty is self-enforcing only between pairs of suffi-ciently close neighbors. Global honesty prevails only in a sufficiently small world. The extent of self-enforcing honesty is likely to decrease when the world expands beyond this size. Costly external enforcement is useful only if the world is sufficiently large, and its net payoff need not be larger than that of a self-governing small community. Inter-mediate-size worlds fare worst.},

The latter is a matter of great practical importance and is of no small significance from the standpoint of political philosophy.--Scott Gordon, Journal of Political Economy James Buchanan offers a strikingly innovative approach to a pervasive problem of social philosophy. The problem is one of the classic paradoxes concerning man's freedom in society: in order to protect individual freedom, the state must restrict each person's right to act. Employing the techniques of modern economic analysis, Professor Buchanan reveals the conceptual basis of an individual's social rights by examining the evolution and development of these rights out of presocial conditions.},

@article{Hurst2011WhatDo,
abstract = {In this paper, we show that substantial differences exists among U.S. small businesses owners with respect to their ex-ante expectations of future performance, their ex-ante desire for future growth, and their initial motives for starting a business. Specifically, using new data that samples early stage entrepreneurs just prior to business start up, we show that few small businesses intend to bring a new idea to market. Instead, most intend to provide an existing service to an existing customer base. Further, using the same data, we find that most small businesses have little desire to grow big or to innovate in any observable way. We show that such behavior is consistent with the industry characteristics of the majority of small businesses, which are concentrated among skilled craftsmen, lawyers, real estate agents, doctors, small shopkeepers, and restaurateurs. Lastly, we show non pecuniary benefits (being one's own boss, having flexibility of hours, etc.) play a first-order role in the business formation decision. We then discuss how our findings suggest that the importance of entrepreneurial talent, entrepreneurial luck, and financial frictions in explaining the firm size distribution may be overstated. We conclude by discussing the potential policy implications of our findings.},

This is especially important in small com-munities where we often see a lack of market-oriented institutions such as venture capital firms. Entrepreneurs gain access to social capital via club memberships. Combining differ-ences in the number of individual club memberships with differences in the importance of social capital across communities, we identify a causal small community mark-up effect of individual club memberships on entrepreneurship. Assuming that unobserved hetero-geneity that might influence both the individual's selection into clubs and the occupational choice to be an entrepreneur is independent of community size, we find that the effect of club membership on the propensity to be an entrepreneur is 2.6 percentage points larger in small communities than in large communities. Robustness tests support the validity of our identifying assumption and results.},

We contrast results obtained in a complete information setting, where coordination is easy, to those obtained in a setting with strategic risk, where players have different assessments of their environment. These two strategic settings allow us to define and distinguish predatory and preemptive incentives as determinants of conflict. We show that while weapons have an unambiguous deterrent effect under complete information, this does not hold anymore under strategic risk. Rather, we find that increases in weapon stocks can have a non-monotonic effect on the sustainability of peace. We also show that under strategic risk, inequality in military strength can ac- tually facilitate peace and that anticipated peace-keeping interventions may improve incentives for peaceful behavior.},

When government is absent, the superior strength of some agents makes it cheaper for them to violently steal what they desire from weaker agents than to use trade to obtain what they want. Such was the case with middlemen who interacted with producers in late precolonial west central Africa. In the face of this threat, producers employed two mech- anisms to make exchange with middlemen possible. On the one hand, they used credit to alter middlemen's cost-benefit structure of engaging in plunder versus trade. On the other hand, producers demanded tribute from traveling traders as a risk premium. By transforming traveling traders' incentive from banditry to peaceful trade and reducing producers' costs associated with inter- acting with middlemen, these mechanisms enhanced both parties' ability to capture the gains from exchange.},

abstract = {Search-theoretic models of monetary exchange are based on explicit descriptions of the frictions that make money essential. However, tractable versions usually have strong assumptions that make them ill suited for discussing some policy questions, especially those concerning changes in the money supply. Hence, most policy analysis uses reduced-form models. The authors propose a framework, designed to help bridge this gap, that is based explicitly on microeconomic frictions, but allows for interesting macroeconomic policy analyses. At the same time, the model is analytically tractable and amenable to quantitative analysis. (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

abstract = {We explore Bayesian persuasion environments in which the state and action spaces are ordered, allowing for complementarity between actions and types. Building on the literature on monotone comparative statics, we identify conditions that guarantee that these are optimal among all (possibly non-monotone) signal structures. When the action space is binary, supermodularity of the sender's and receiver's preferences suffices for the optimal signal to have a monotone structure. With a continuum of actions, the conditions are more intriguing. We identify a novel single-crossing condition using a virtual utility representation of the sender's payoff. We also provide a technique to compute the optimal monotone signal structure, even when this monotonicity is due to an exogenous constraint. Applications are given to quadratic loss functions with biases, capacity constraints, and credit ratings. *},

The formulation of the problem as one of self-selection not only shows more clearly the similarity between this problem and a number of other problems (such as the optimal pricing of a monopolist) which have recently been the subject of extensive research, but also allows the derivation of a number of new results. We establish (i) under fairly weak conditions, randomization of tax structures is desirable; (ii) if different individuals are not perfect substitutes for one another in production, then the general equilibrium effects-until now largely ignored in the literature-of changes in the tax structure may be dominant in determining the optimal tax structure; in particular if the relative wage of high ability and low ability individuals depends on the relative supplies of labor, the optimal tax structure entails a negative marginal tax rate on the high ability individuals, and a positive marginal tax rate on the low ability individuals (the marnitude of which depends on the elasticity of substitution); (iii) if individuals differ in their preferences, Pareto efficient taxation may entail negative marginal tax rates for high incomes; while (iv) if wage income is stochastic, the marginal tax rate at the upper end may be 100{\%}. Our analysis thus makes clear that the main qualitative properties of the optimal tax structure to which earlier studies called attention are not robust to these attempts to make the theory more realistic. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

Many models have been proposed, but perhaps the most important in current use, apart from the original linear expenditure system, are the Rotterdam model and the translog model. Both of these models have been extensively estimated and have, in addition, been used to test the homogeneity and symmetry restrictions of demand theory. In this paper, we propose and estimate a new model which is of comparable generality to the Rotterdam and translog models but which has considerable advantages over both. The model, which we call the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), gives an arbitrary first-order approximation to any demand system; it satisfies the axioms of choice exactly; it aggregates perfectly over consumers without invoking parallel linear Engel curves; it has a functional form which is consistent with known household-budget data; it is simple to estimate, largely avoiding the need for non-linear estimation; and it can be used to test the restrictions of homogeneity and symmetry through linear restrictions on fixed parameters.},

@article{Board2011RelationalLoyalty,
abstract = {Firms routinely rely on the goodwill of their trading partners. In developed econo-mies, ongoing relationships complement formal contracts in mitigating holdup and facilitating transactions (Stewart Macaulay 1963). In developing economies, where contracts enjoy little legal protection, long-term relationships are even more critical for trade (John McMillan and Christopher Woodruff 1999). The major cost of maintaining a relationship is that, when there are many poten-tial suppliers, it can reduce the scope of trade. The purpose of this paper is to make this trade-off precise. We consider a firm (principal) that would like to trade with different suppliers (agents) over time under the threat of holdup. We derive the opti-mal relational contract, show that it induces loyalty, and characterize the resulting distortions. The model enables us to make predictions as to when a firm will switch suppliers, and how these switches depend on the length of the relationship, the num-ber of suppliers, and the shocks to the economy. The following examples illustrate the practical importance of loyalty in overcom-ing the holdup problem. In 1984, the US government started awarding {\$}200 billion worth of contracts through " full and open competition, " either in the form of sealed bids or competitive negotiations. In order to reduce corruption, the evaluation panel was instructed to ignore subjective information, such as prior performance. Steven Kelman (1990) examines computer procurement, showing that the government was considerably less loyal than private firms (awarding 58 percent of contracts to the incumbent versus 78 percent), and that it was more likely to use the cheapest bid-der (65 percent versus 41 percent). As a result, he finds that government contractors overpromised more than private contractors, leading managers to be 50 percent more dissatisfied and to be involved in more formal disputes. The government contracts rated particularly badly on " keeping promises " and " sticking to the contracted deliv-ery schedule, " with vendors holding up the government by withdrawing key person-nel, providing poor advice and few creative ideas. He concludes that " Lacking the ability to recoup transaction specific investments through the assurance of repeat business, [government] vendors fail to make investments that require conscious effort and expenditure of resources " (Kelman 1990, p. 72).},

The flattening effect provides a precise meaning to the statement that under perfect competition individuals cannot influence prices; they face perfectly elastic demands and supplies. The attractive geometry associated with arbitrage and the flattening effect is highlighted in several figures. We also link the demonstration of equilibrium through arbitrage with the logic of marginalism.Journal of Economic LiteratureClassification Number: D51. {\textcopyright} 1998 Academic Press.},

It argues that such models are not abstractions from, or simplifications of, the real world. They describe counterfactual worlds which the modeller has constructed. The gap between model world and real world can be filled only by inductive inference, and we can have more confidence in such inferences, the more credible the model is as an account of what could have been true.},

The key to the approach is the use of a single, specified commodity as "cash," which may or may not have intrinsic value. The model, in several variants, is treated as a noncooperative game, in the spirit of Nash and Cournot. The rules of the game, including the price-forming mechanism, are independent of behavioral or equilibrium assumptions, which enter, instead, through the solutions of the game.},

In the finite case, optimal coordination mechanisms can be found by linear programming. Some basic issues relating to systems with many principals are also discussed.

We describe a number of economic applications that fall in this category. We also explore the distinctive roles of public and private information in this setting, review results for general global games, discuss the relationship between global games and a literature on higher order beliefs in game theory and describe the relationship to local interaction games and dynamic games with payoff shocks.},

abstract = {The general equilibrium model of market pricing and the duality theory of linear programming (LP) are paradigmatic expressions of the duality relation between quantities and prices. While LP is canonical, the market duality found in general equilibrium theory is regarded as the more comprehensive in the sense that LP models of markets are special cases of the general equilibrium model. This paper shows that by adopting an infinite-dimensional perspective, the general equilibrium model of market pricing can be formulated to fit inside LP theory. When utility is quasi-linear (transferable), LP solutions to the primal and dual coincide with market equilibria. When utility is ordinal, we show that LP theory can nevertheless be used to characterize market equilibrium through the money metric utility representation of preferences. A key feature of the LP formulation is that not only commodities, but also individuals, are " right-hand side constraints " of the LP problem. An implica-tion of this feature, not explicitly found in the market equilibrium model, is the emergence of the individual as a margin of analysis and, dually, the prices of individuals. The individual as a margin of analysis is important in high-lighting the properties of perfectly competitive equilibrium not emphasized in the general equilibrium model. It is also central to the relation between mar-ket equilibrium and game-theoretic concepts such as the core and the Shapley value in models with a continuum of individuals. Using the LP perspective, we demonstrate the connections among market equilibrium, the core and the Shapley value for models with both transferable and ordinal utility.},

We show that Kirzner's central concept of entrepreneurial discovery has been vastly influential in theoretical and applied work on entrepreneurship, even though Kirzner's larger research program has not been well understood. We also describe and assess a number of methodological, ontological, and cognitive critiques of the opportunity-discovery approach and review the most important alternatives, including the judgment-based view associated with Knight (1921) and more recent contributors. We conclude that the entrepreneurship and management literatures provide a useful example of how Austrian economics—Kirznerian economics in particular—can play an important role in shaping mainstream discussions, debates, and research programs in the social sciences.},

abstract = {This paper considers the enforceability of employment contracts when employees' performance cannot be verified in court so that piece-rate contrasts are not legally enforceable. Part I shows that there exists a not legally enforceable. Part I shows that there exists a variety of self-enforcing implicit contracts, modelled as perfect equilibria in a repeated game, and characterizes all the wage and performance outcomes that can be implemented. Implementation requires a strictly positive surplus from employment, the form of the contract depending on how this surplus is divided between firm and employee. Piece-rate contracts, and contracts with an informally agreed bonus, can be made self-enforcing but the use of severance pay and bonding does not extend the set of implementable allocations. The resulting contracts resemble actual labor contracts more than do the contracts in standard principal-agent models. Part II analyses market equilibrium with these contracts, also modelled as perfect equilibria in a repeated game, and shows that many such equilibria exist. Unfilled vacancies and unemployed workers can co-exist despite the existence of contracts that are potentially mutually beneficial. For those jobs that are filled, any division of the potential surplus is possible so that the market can have, at the same time, involuntary unemployment and vacancies that are unfilled depsite filled jobs earning positive profits. As a criterion for selecting equilibria, a notion of renogotiation proofness is is applied. Then either all workers are employed or all jobs filled but any division of the potential surplus is still possible. The paper explores what further restrictions on beliefs give rise to a Walrasian outcome, in which all the potential surplus goes to the short side of the market, and to an efficiency wage type outcome, in which the potential surplus goes to the long side.},

Whereas recent research underpins the theoretical proposition of a positive correlation between risk attitudes and the decision to become self-employed, the effects on survival are not as straightforward. Psychological research posits an inverse U-shaped relationship between risk attitudes and entrepreneurial survival. On the basis of experimentally validated data of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we examine the extent to which risk attitudes influence survival rates in self-employment in Germany. The empirical results confirm that persons whose risk attitudes are in the medium range survive significantly longer as entrepreneurs than do persons with particularly low or high risk attitudes.},

@article{Takii2009a,
abstract = {This paper models entrepreneurship as the entrepreneur's information processing activity in order to predict changes in demand and reallocate resources. The results show that allocative efficiency—and therefore aggregate productivity—increases through intensified competition by entrepreneurs grasping at opportunities. This fierce competition leads to price reductions that result in the improvement of measured aggregate productivity. The price reduction also forces relatively less able entrepreneurs to become workers. As resources are then dealt with only by relatively talented entrepreneurs, this selection effect also increases aggregate productivity. The paper also discusses how the selection effect influences the distribution of firm size. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

For a fixed game and action define the dis-tance between a pair of types as the difference between the smallest for which the action is interim correlated rationalizable. We define a strategic topology in which a sequence of types converges if and only if this distance tends to zero for any action and game. Thus a sequence of types converges in the strategic topol-ogy if that smallest does not jump either up or down in the limit. As applied to sequences, the upper-semicontinuity property is equivalent to convergence in the product topology, but the lower-semicontinuity property is a strictly stronger requirement, as shown by the electronic mail game.

abstract = {Now that the Marxist project of human transformation through the elimination of self-interest and markets stands thoroughly discredited, it is time to acknowledge Adam Smith as one of the most important social thinkers of modern times. Smith's Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, argued that a market economy was not only best able to meet the material needs of the people; it also provided a moral system which relied on human nature to create order and fairness. But Smith's intentions and conclusions, much maligned by his opponents on the left, have just as often been misunderstood by his conservative defenders. Counter to the popular impression that Smith was a champion of selfishness and greed, Jerry Z. Muller shows in this powerful and provocative work of historical reconstruction that Smith hoped to promote the welfare of society as a whole, and that he wrote The Wealth of Nations to warn of the dangers to the common good posed by organized mercantile interests. And contrary to those who believe that the naked pursuit of self-interest always leads to socially beneficial results, Smith maintained that government must intervene to counteract its negative effects. Smith's analysis went beyond economics to embrace a larger "civilizing project" designed to create a more decent society. The freedom made possible by a commercial society, Smith thought, would only be desirable when coupled with supporting institutions - including the law, family, and religion - which fostered the virtues of self-control and altruism that people need to manage their new liberty. He also explained how human passions could be harnessed to that goal. In doing so, helaid the ground for much of modern social science, as he explored the unanticipated consequences of social action, the social formation of conscience, and the linkages between social, political, and economic institutions.

abstract = {If competitive equilibrium is defined as a situation in which prices are such that all arbitrage profits are eliminated, is it possible that a competitive economy always be in equilibrium? Clearly not, for then those who arbitrage make no (private) return from their (privately) costly activity. Hence the assumptions that all markets, including that for information, are always in equilibrium and always perfectly arbitraged are inconsistent when arbitrage is costly. We propose here a model in which there is an equilibrium degree of disequilibrium: prices reflect the information of informed individuals (arbitrageurs) but only partially, so that those who expend resources to obtain information do receive compensation. How informative the price system is depends on the number of individuals who are informed; but the number of individuals who are informed is itself an endogenous variable in the model. The model is the simplest one in which prices perform a well-articulated role in conveying information from the informed to the uninformed. When informed individuals observe information that the return to a security is going to be high, they bid its price up, and conversely when they observe information that the return is going to be low. Thus the price system makes publicly available the information obtained by informed individuals to the uniformed. In general, however, it does this imperfectly; this is perhaps lucky, for were it to do it perfectly, an equilibrium would not exist. In the introduction, we shall discuss the general methodology and present some conjectures concerning certain properties of the equilibrium. The remaining analytic sections of the paper are devoted to analyzing in detail an important example of our general model, in which our conjectures concerning the nature of the equilibrium can be shown to be correct. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our approach and results, with particular emphasis on the relationship of our results to the literature on "efficient capital markets."},

abstract = {Observed fiscal policy varies greatly across time and countries. How can we explain this variation? This paper surveys the recent literature that has tried to answer this question. We adopt a unified approach in portraying public policy as the equilibrium outcome of an explicitly specified political process. We divide the material into three parts. In Part I, we focus on median-voter equilibria that apply to policy issues where disagreement between voters is likely to be one-dimensional. We thus study the general redistributive programs, typical of the modern welfare state: redistribution between rich and poor, young and old, employed and unemployed, and labor and capital. In Part II we study special-interest politics. Here, the policy problem is multi-dimensional and we focus on specific political mechanisms: we study legislative bargaining, lobbying, and electoral competition, as well as the possible interactions between these different forms of political activity. Finally, in Part III we deal with "comparative politics", namely policy choice under alternative political constitutions. Here, we model the rationale for separation of powers; we also contrast stylized features of majoritarian and proportional electoral rules, as well as congressional and parliamentary political regimes, focusing on their implications for rent extraction by politicians, redistribution and public goods provision. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{Buchanan1959PositiveEconomy,
abstract = {Economic theory, as we know it, was developed largely by utilitarians. Ad-mitting the measurability and interpersonal comparability of utility and ac-cepting the maximization of utility as an ethically desirable social goal, neo-classical economists were able to combine an instinctively human zeal for social reform with subjectively satisfactory scientific integrity. The positivist revolution has sharply disturbed this scholarly equilibrium. If utility is neither cardinally measurable nor comparable among persons, the economist who seeks to remain "pure" must proceed with caution in discussing social policy. The "positive" economist becomes an inventor of testable hypotheses, and his professional place in policy formation bec'omes wholly indirect. Milton Friedman has provided the clearest statement of the positivist posi-tion,' and he has called for a distinct separation between the scientific and the non-scientific behavior of individuals calling themselves economists. But economics, as a discipline, will probably continue to attract precisely those scholars who desire to assist in policy formation and to do so professionally. The social role of the economist remains that of securing more intelligent legis-lation, and the incremental additions to the state of knowledge which "posi-tive" economics may make seems to shut off too large an area of discussion from his professional competence. Does there exist a role for the political economist as such? This essay will examine this question and suggest an approach.2 I. THE NEW WELFARE ECONOMICS The "new" welfare economics was born in response to the challenge posed by the positivist revolution. The intellectual source of this subdiscipline is Pareto, whose earlier attempts to introduce scientific objectivity into the social studies led him to enunciate the now-famous definition of "optimality" or 'M. Friedman, Essays in Positive Economics 3-43 (1953). 'The approach which will be suggested here involves an extension of some of Wicksell's ideas on fiscal theory to modern welfare economics. For a recently published translation of Wicksell's fiscal theory, see "A New Principle of Just Taxation," in Classics in the Theory of Public Finance 72 (Musgrave and Peacock ed., 1958).},

We emphasize connections between theory and empirical work that were initially lacking from optimal income tax theory. First, we provide historical and international background on labor income taxation and means-tested transfers. Second, we present the simple model of optimal linear taxation. Third, we consider optimal nonlinear income taxation with particular emphasis on the optimal top tax rate and the optimal profile of means-tested transfers. Fourth, we consider various extensions of the standard model including tax avoidance and income shifting, international migration, models with rent-seeking, relative income concerns, the treatment of couples and children, and non-cash transfers. Finally, we discuss limitations of the standard utilitarian approach and briefly review alternatives. In all cases, we use the simplest possible models and show how optimal tax formulas can be derived and expressed in terms of sufficient statistics that include social marginal welfare weights capturing society's value for redistribution, behavioral elasticities capturing the efficiency costs of taxation, as well as parameters of the earnings distribution. We also emphasize connections between actual practice and the predictions from theory, and in particular the limitations of both theory and empirical work in settling the political debate on optimal labor income taxation and transfers. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

When the relationship broke down in the early 1630s, WIC officials in New Netherland, distracted by personal and political feuds in the Dutch colony, were remarkably slow to repair the alliance. The inability of the WIC to restore stable relations with the Pequots drew the attention of the neighboring Puritan colonies, who coveted the fertile lands of the Connecticut Valley.

abstract = {We examine the pricing of financial crash insurance during the 2007– 2009 financial crisis in US option markets, and we show that a large amount of aggregate tail risk is missing from the cost of financial sector crash insurance during the crisis. The difference in costs between out-of-the-money put options for individual banks and puts on the financial sector index increases four-fold from its precrisis 2003–2007 level. We provide evidence that a collective government guarantee for the financial sector lowers index put prices far more than those of individual banks and explains the increase in the basket-index put spread. (JEL E44, G01, G13, G21, G28, H81) Investors can purchase out-of-the-money (OTM) put options to insure their posi-tions in the event of a price crash. During the 2007–2009 financial crisis, an episode of elevated systemic risk, the price of crash insurance for the US financial sector as a whole was surprisingly low. Our paper documents that OTM put options for the financial sector stock index were extraordinarily cheap relative to OTM put options on the individual banks that comprise the index. The cost of a basket of individual bank put options exceeded the cost of the index put by 69 percent in March 2009, or by 12.4 cents per dollar of insurance. Between 2003 and 2007, before the onset of the crisis, this basket-index put spread never exceeded 3.3 cents per dollar. The increase in the basket-index spread in the financial sector during the crisis is puzzling. The basket of put options provides insurance against both sector-wide and idiosyncratic bank stock crashes, while the index put option only insures against a sector-wide crash. Standard option pricing logic therefore implies that a dispropor-tionate increase in idiosyncratic risk (relative to aggregate risk) is needed to explain the dramatic increase in the basket-index put spread during the crisis. This creates a},

Out-of-the-money (OTM) put options are insurance in the case of a price crash. During the crisis, an index of these OTM put options was very cheap, relative to a combination of the banks in the index, 12.4 cents per dollar of insurance. This spread increased during the crisis. This seems odd, since buying your own basket insures against individual bank failures and systematic failures, while the index only insures against systematic failure.

The authors hypothesize that the reason is because there was an implicit governmental guarantee for the industry, but not for the individual banks. This spread did not occur in other sectors and the Black-Scholes formula matches data well.

Theoretically, a cap on losses in a Merton jump model (Merton 1976) can produce this spread.},

Moreover, it was the Iroquois who determined how and with whom the trade was conducted.

abstract = {We study markets in which agents first make investments and are then matched into potentially productive partnerships. Equilibrium investments and the equilibrium matching will be efficient if agents can simultaneously negotiate investments and matches, but we focus on markets in which agents must first sink their investments before matching. Additional equilibria may arise in this sunk-investment setting, even though our matching market is competitive. These equilibria exhibit inefficiencies that we can interpret as coordination failures. All allocations satisfying a constrained efficiency property are equilibria, and the converse holds if preferences satisfy a separability condition. We identify sufficient conditions (most notably, quasiconcave utilities) for the investments of matched agents to satisfy an exchange efficiency property as well as sufficient conditions (most notably, a single crossing property) for agents to be matched positive assortatively, with these conditions then forming the core of sufficient conditions for the efficiency of equilibrium allocations.

@article{Stiglitz1971,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to answer the following three questions: (1) What kinds of distortions are "best to have", if as appears to be the case, you must have them? We shall show that if no restrictions are imposed on the set of commodity and factor taxes (in particular, if a 100 per cent profits tax can be levied) then no distortionary factor taxes should be imposed, but as soon as any of the innumerable restrictions which in fact obtain are taken into account, this is no longer true. More precisely, we shall analyze the optimal structure of factor and commodity taxation under a number of alternative sets of restrictions on the set of feasible taxes. (2) What is the optimal supply of public goods, when revenue for these goods must be raised by distortionary taxation? We not only shall show that the conventional rule, that the sum of the marginal rates of substitution (over all individuals) should equal the marginal rate of transformation, no longer obtains, but also shall ascertain under what conditions the conventional rule represents an oversupply and when it represents an undersupply. (3) What is the correct relationship between shadow prices in the public sector, and marginal rates of transformation and substitution in the private sector, when the sources of the divergences are (optimally chosen) distortionary taxes? We shall show that none of the prevalently held current views on this subject is completely correct. In this paper, we are concerned with the efficiency (distortionary) aspects of taxation, rather than with their redistributive implications, although the two cannot really be separated out. We therefore focus on the simplified case of identical individuals, and hence on the first two types of differential taxation discussed above.},

This is both a theoretical and an econometric exercise as the analysis is linked to a rigorously delineated model of interdependent decisions. We develop an incomplete information game that describes individual choices in the presence of social interactions. The equilibrium strategy profiles are linear. Standard models in the empirical social interactions literature are shown to be exact or approximate special cases of our general framework, which in turn provides a basis for understanding the microeconomic foundations of those models. We consider identification of both endogenous (peer) and contextual social effects under alternative assumptions on a priori information about network structure available to an analyst, and contrast the informational content of individual-level and aggregated data. Finally, we discuss potential ramifications for identification of endogenous group selection and differences between the information sets of analysts and agents.},

@article{Samuelson2017EvenRelationships,
abstract = {When are economic interactions mediated by prices and transfers, and when are they mediated by variations in the continuation payoffs within a relationship? To address this question, we examine a relationship between two players who periodically face opportunities to undertake randomly generated ???projects??? that impose a cost on one player and a benefit on the other, as well as opportunities to make voluntary transfers to one another. We characterize the set of equilibria, with particular emphasis on the efficient frontier. In the absence of transfers, incentives are often created by adjusting the continuation values of the relationship, sometimes increasing player 1's continuation payoff (to induce player 1 to accept a particularly costly current project) and sometimes increasing player 2's continuation payoff. In contrast, once transfers enter the picture, continuation payoffs maximize the sum of the two players??? payoffs, no matter how asymmetric the point on the Pareto frontier under consideration. However, transfers can also be relatively rare, and in particular can occur less often than the adjustments in continuation values that occur without transfers. Players thus rely on transfers to create incentives, but manage to do so while rarely making transfers.},

Economic models of-ten have many rationalizable outcomes, motivating economists to use refinements of rationalizability, including equilibrium refinements. In this paper we try to achieve a general understanding of when this multiplicity occurs and how one should deal with it. Assuming that the set of possible payoff functions and belief structures is sufficiently rich, we establish a revealing structure of the correspondence of beliefs to sets of ratio-nalizable outcomes. We show that, for any rationalizable action a of any type, we can perturb the beliefs of the type in such a way that a is uniquely rationalizable for the new type. This unique outcome will be robust to further small changes. When multiplicity occurs, then we are in a " knife-edge " case, where the unique rationalizable outcome changes, sandwiched between open sets of types where each of the rationalizable ac-tions is uniquely rationalizable. As an immediate application of this result, we charac-terize, for any refinement of rationalizability, the predictions that are robust to small misspecifications of interim beliefs. These are only those predictions that are true for all rationalizable strategies, that is, the predictions that could have been made without the refinement.},

abstract = {This is a study of the way people organize the use of resources in order to maximize the value of their economic rights over these resources. A person's economic property rights over an asset are defined here as the person's ability to gain from the asset by direct consumption or by exchange. It is prohibitively costly to measure accurately all assets' attributes ; therefore, rights to them are never fully delineated. Property is consequently in danger of appropriation by others-by theft and also by excessive choosing, adverse selection, free riding, and shirking. Individuals enhance their rights (incurring transaction costs) by the protection and better delineation of their assets. In this new edition, Professor Barzel devotes a separate chapter to the firm and emphasizes the central role of equity capital as guarantor of the activities of the firm. In addition, he elaborates on the distinction between economic and legal rights and discusses the emergence of the state. Cambridge Books Online},

@article{Decker2014TheDynamism,
abstract = {An optimal pace of business dynamics—encompassing the processes of entry, exit, expansion, and contraction—would balance the benefits of productivity and economic growth against the costs to firms and workers associated with reallocation of productive resources. It is difficult to prescribe what the optimal pace should be, but evidence accumulating from multiple datasets and methodologies suggests that the rate of business startups and the pace of employment dynamism in the US economy has fallen over recent decades and that this downward trend accelerated after 2000. A critical factor in accounting for the decline in business dynamics is a lower rate of business startups and the related decreasing role of dynamic young businesses in the economy. For example, the share of US employment accounted for by young firms has declined by almost 30 percent over the last 30 years. These trends suggest that incentives for entrepreneurs to start new firms in the United States have diminished over time. We do not identify all the factors underlying these trends in this paper but offer some clues based on the empirical patterns for specific sectors and geographic regions.},

Second, we provide an equivalence result, whereby the resulting set of equilibrium allocations with self-enforcing private debt is equivalent to the allocations that are sustained with unbacked public debt or rational bubbles. In contrast to the classic result by Bulow and Rogoff (1989a), positive levels of debt are sustainable in our environment because the interest rate is sufficiently low to provide repayment incentives.

Citizens are imperfectly informed about the regime's ability to resist an uprising and the regime can engage in propaganda that, taken at face-value, makes the regime seem stronger than it truly is. This coordination game with endogenous information manipulation has a unique equilibrium and the article gives a complete analytic characterization of the equilibrium's comparative statics. Holding fixed the number of signals available to citizens, if the per-unit signal precision is sufficiently high then the regime is harder to overthrow. In contrast, if the number of signals increases, so that both total signal precision and the regime's costs of manipulation rise together, then the regime is easier to overthrow unless there are strong economies of scale in information control.

Furthermore, optimal contracts cannot be replicated by short-term contracts. A family of fixed interval review contracts is characterized.

Finally, these contracts are shown approximate first best if players are very patient.},

One unsettled question is whether income inequality affects the likelihood of revolt. This paper takes an approach different from previous studies by introducing data derived from two surveys of revolutionary preferences across a quarter‐million randomly sampled individuals. More people are found to have a preference for revolt when inequality in their nation is high. A 1‐standard‐deviation increase in the Gini coefficient explains up to 38 percent of the standard deviation in revolutionary support. The results hold after controlling for a set of personal characteristics and country and year fixed effects. Since higher levels of income are found to have a negative impact on the taste for revolt, the results suggest that either “going for growth” or implementing policies that reduce inequality can buy off those individuals with revolutionary preferences.},

The state of the project progresses gradually at a rate that depends on the agents' cumulative efforts, and it is completed once it teaches a pre-specified threshold, at which point it generates a lump sum payoff. We characterize a budget balanced mechanism which at every moment, induces each agent to exert the first best effort level as the outcome of a Markov Perfect Equilibrium, thus eliminating the free-rider problem. This mechanism specifies for each agent flow payments that are due while the project is in progress, and rewards that are disbursed upon completion of the project. The payments are placed in a savings account that accumulates interest, and their magnitude is chosen to balance the budget. Our mechanism resembles the incentives structure in early-stage entrepreneurial ventures and it can shed light on why the free-rider problem is not as prevalent as traditional economic models suggest.},

Rather than make this assumption, this paper uses the core to model the competition between the firms. Two conditions are shown to be sufficient for efficient spatial competition. The first is that the firms' location choices satisfy a no-externalities condition. The second is that the second-stage game satisfy a separable-value condition, namely that the value (gains from trade) can be created on a buyer-by-buyer basis. This approach yields two further benefits. First, efficient location can be stable in situations with arbitrary distributions of buyers, arbitrary willingness-to-pay functions, and completely general location spaces. Second, efficiency in location games can be shown to be related to the Second Welfare Theorem.},

We show that when parties do not know voters' preferences precisely, all voters ex ante prefer some platform divergence to convergence at the ex ante median. After characterizing the unique symmetric equilibrium of competition between responsible (policy-motivated) parties, we conclude that all voters ex ante prefer responsible parties to opportunistic (purely office-motivated) ones when parties are sufficiently ideologically polarized that platforms diverge, but not so polarized that they diverge excessively.

abstract = {What is the effect of offering agents an option to delay their choices in a global coordination game? We address this question by considering a canonical binary action global game, and allowing players to delay their irreversible decisions. Those that delay have access to accurate private information at the second stage, but receive lower payoffs. We show that, as noise vanishes, as long as the benefit to taking the risky action early is greater than the benefit of taking the risky action late, the introduction of the option to delay reduces the incidence of coordination failure in equilibrium relative to the standard case where all agents must choose their actions at the same time. We outline the welfare implications of this finding, and probe the robustness of our results from a variety of angles. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A broader notion of competitive equilibrium called full appropriation replaces the standard Walrasian price directed representation. The replacement emphasizes the relation between competition and property rights. A formulation of how things get done along with a proprietary specification of know-how replaces the traditional description of production. In the resulting model, the phenomenon of internal organization reflects the necessarily partial role of the price system in an expanded description of resource allocation , in contrast to the view that internal organization is evidence of the price system's deficiency. The employment contract, where workers agree to take direction from an employer, is based on the employer's know-how, the payment to the employer measuring the marginal product of proprietary knowledge. From the appropriation perspective, restraints on shirking are adaptations allowing the employer to appropriate a greater fraction of the value of know-how, rather than the essence of the employment contract. The relation between ownership and control and opportunistic issues underlying the holdup problem are similarly addressed as variations on the theme of appropriability.},

Demange and Gale showed that the set of competitive equilibria in this type of market forms a complete lattice with each extreme point of the lattice representing an equilibrium with the highest utilities for the agents on one side and the lowest utilities for the agents on the opposite side. Our characterization is based on establishing a connection between the competitive equilibria of a market and the competitive equilibria of certain strict subsets of that market-each obtained by removing exactly one agent. This characterization captures the effect of competition when agents are added to the market or removed from the market. It gives a precise procedure for constructing competitive equilibria and provides a constructive proof of existence of such equilibria; in contrast, previous proofs have been based on fixed point theorems.},

Equilibrium corresponds to the limit of a differ- entiated products Bertrand game. We apply the model to establish theoretical results on the equilibrium effects of mandates. Mandates can increase efficiency but have unintended consequences. With adverse selection, an insurance mandate reduces the price of low-coverage policies, which necessarily has indirect effects such as increasing adverse selection on the intensive margin and causing some consumers to purchase less coverage.},

The allocation of entrepreneurial attention thus endogenizes the number of uses to which attention can be allocated and the opportunity cost of attention.

abstract = {Global games of regime change—coordination games of incomplete information in which a status quo is abandoned once a sufficiently large fraction of agents attack it— have been used to study crises phenomena such as currency attacks, bank runs, debt crises, and political change. We extend the static benchmark examined in the literature by allowing agents to take actions in many periods and to learn about the underlying fundamentals over time. We first provide a simple recursive algorithm for the charac-terization of monotone equilibria. We then show how the interaction of the knowledge that the regime survived past attacks with the arrival of information over time, or with changes in fundamentals, leads to interesting equilibrium properties. First, multiplic-ity may obtain under the same conditions on exogenous information that guarantee uniqueness in the static benchmark. Second, fundamentals may predict the eventual fate of the regime but not the timing or the number of attacks. Finally, equilibrium dy-namics can alternate between phases of tranquility—where no attack is possible—and phases of distress—where a large attack can occur—even without changes in funda-mentals.},

By retaining a single-exchange simplification, the economic analysis of property has encouraged views that: overemphasize the initial allocation of property rights, while some form of recurrent allocation is often needed; pay scant attention to legal rights, although these determine enforceability and, therefore, economic value; and overestimate the power of unregulated private ordering, despite its inability to protect third parties.

In contrast to Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) individuals have individual-specific production technologies. It is demonstrated that the production efficiency theorem generally breaks down. Outputs of commodities should be taxed at higher (lower) rates if high-(low-)ability agents have a comparative advantage in producing them. In addition, outputs of commodities should be taxed relatively less when labor supply is more complementary to these outputs. Aggregate production efficiency is obtained only when the production technology for outputs does not depend on ability and is weakly separable from labor. The breakdown of the Diamond-Mirrlees production efficiency theorem has potentially important policy implications. JEL code: H2},

We propose an exploration of rationalizability in the context of games with a continuum of players. We deal with a special class of these games, in which payoff of each player depends only on his own strategy and on an aggregate value: the state of the game, which is obtained from the complete action profile. We define the sets of point-rationalizable states and rationalizable states. For the case of continuous payoffs and compact strategy sets, we characterize these sets and prove their convexity and compactness.

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of investment timing under uncertainty in a duopoly framework. When both firms want to be the first investor a coordination problem arises. Here, a method is proposed to deal with this coordination problem, involving the use of symmetric mixed strategies. The method is based on Fudenberg and Tirole [Fudenberg, D., Tirole, J., 1985. Preemption and rent equalization in the adoption of new technology. Review of Economic Studies 52, 383-401], where it was designed within a deterministic framework. This paper extends the applicability of this method to a stochastic environment. The need for this is exemplified by the fact that ever more contributions in multiple firm real option models make unsatisfactory assumptions to solve the coordination problem mentioned above. Moreover, our approach allows us to show that in many cases it is incorrect to claim that, in equilibrium, the probability that both firms invest simultaneously while it is only optimal for one firm to invest, is zero. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We introduce the notion of pre-muneration values-the values to the transacting agents prior to any transfers-created by a buyer-seller match. Personalized-price equilibrium outcomes are independent of premuneration values and exhibit inefficiencies only in the event of "coordination failures," while uniform-price equilibria depend on premuneration values and, in general, feature inefficient investments even without coordination failures. There is thus a trade-off between the costs of personalizing prices and the inefficient investments under uniform prices. We characterize the premuneration values under which uniform-price equilibria similarly exhibit inefficiencies only in the event of coordination failures.},

abstract = {EXECUTIVE SUMMARY As the payments landscape evolves, cash remains a unique, resilient, and heavily used consumer payment instrument. Still, with new payment options and ways to shop, consumers are adapting how they view and use cash. The Diary of Consumer Payment Choice (Diary) serves as the Cash Product Office's (CPO) primary data source on consumer payment behavior. Insights from the Diary, and other data sources, help the CPO understand the role that cash will play in the future. This research helps the Federal Reserve (Fed) fulfill its objectives of maintaining confidence in U.S. currency and promoting a safe and efficient payment system. When first conducted in 2012, the Diary showed that cash was the most frequently used payment instrument and that cash use was prevalent across all demographic groups. The key findings of the 2015 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice are similar and suggest that:  Cash continues to be the most frequently used consumer payment instrument  Cash is widely used in a variety of circumstances  Cash dominates small-value transactions  The average value of cash holdings has grown The 2015 results also show that cash is facing competition from other payment instruments. In 2015, 32 percent of consumer transactions were made with cash, compared with 40 percent in 2012. Growing consumer comfort with payment cards and the growth of online commerce, among other factors, contribute to this trend. Nonetheless, a broad range of results suggests that cash remains resilient and continues to play a key and unique role for consumers. The first section of the paper discusses high-level, aggregate trends in cash demand and in financial institutions' currency orders and deposits with the Fed. The second section focuses on four findings about cash use from the 2015 Diary, outlined above. The final section explores three insights that the 2015 data},

With two (possibly asymmetric) senders, we fully characterize the generically unique equilibrium, and show that it has a simple linear structure. We find that a sender who faces a stronger opponent engages in more aggressive disclosure in terms of second-order stochastic dominance. With multiple symmetric senders, we fully characterize the unique symmetric equilibrium. We then show that all senders engage in full disclosure in the limit as the number of senders goes to infinity.

We consider dynamic stochastic models with general and heterogeneous bequest tastes and labor productivities. We limit our selves to simple but realistic linear or two-bracket tax structures to obtain tractable formulas. We show that long-run optimal inheritance tax rates can always be expressed in terms of aggregate earnings and bequest elasticities with respect to tax rates, dis tributional parameters, and social preferences for redistribution. Those results carry over with tractable modifications to (a) the case with social discounting (instead of steady-state welfare maximization), (b) the case with partly accidental bequests, (c) the standard Barro-Becker dynastic model. The optimal tax rate is positive and quantita tively large if the elasticity of bequests to the tax rate is low, bequest concentration is high, and society cares mostly about those receiving little inheritance.

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to extend existing search-theoretic models of fiat money, which until now have assumed that the price level is exogenous, by explicitly incorporating bilateral bargaining. This allows us to determine the price level endogenously and leads to additional insights concerning the role of money. For example, we find that monetary equilibria are generally inefficient in the sense that output and prices differ from the solution to a social planner's problem, although the difference can become small as the discount rate or search friction vanishes. We also find that there exist nonsta-tionary inflationary equilibria.},

A novel survey question from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study – whether the taxes paid by unskilled workers are too high, adequate or too low – are used to elicit attitudes toward redistribution. Intergenerational mobility with regard to long-term earnings is measured using a rich panel data spanning an observation window of 22 years. The results reveal that intergenerational mobility is significantly related to preferences for redistribution. The empirical results yield strong and robust support for Piketty's (1995) rational-learning theory: individuals who experience upward (downward) intergenerational mobility are less (more) likely to favor redistribution taxation policies.},

@article{Gershkov2009OptimalAcquisition,
abstract = {A group of individuals with identical preferences must make a decision under uncertainty about which decision is best. Before the decision is made, each agent can privately acquire a costly and imperfect signal. We discuss how to design a mechanism for eliciting and aggregating the collected information so as to maximize ex-ante social welfare. We first show that, of all mechanisms, a sequential one is optimal and works as follows. At random, one agent at a time is selected to acquire information and report the resulting signal. Agents are informed of neither their position in the sequence nor of other reports. Acquiring information when called upon and reporting truthfully is an equilibrium. We next characterize the ex-ante optimal scheme among all ex-post efficient mechanisms. In this mechanism, a decision is made when the precision of the posterior exceeds a cut-off that decreases with each additional report. The restriction to ex-post efficiency is shown to be without loss when the available signals are sufficiently imprecise. On the other hand, ex-post efficient mechanisms are shown to be suboptimal when the cost of information acquisition is sufficiently small. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

THE ambiguity of the title of this paper is not accidental. Its main subject is, of course, the role which assumptions and propositions about the knowledge possessed by the different members of society play in economic analysis. But this is by no means unconnected with the other question which might be discussed under the same title, the question to what extent formal economic analysis conveys any know-ledge about what happens in the real world. Indeed my main contention will be that the tautologies, of which formal equilibrium analysis in economics essentially consists, can be turned into propositions which tell us anything about causation in the real world only in so far as we are able to fill those formal propositions with definite statements about how knowledge is acquired and communicated.

Parties place different values on the public good, and these values may change over time. We focus on budgetary institutions that determine the rules governing feasible allocations to mandatory and discretionary spending programs. Mandatory spending is enacted by law and remains in effect until changed, and thus induces an endogenous status quo, whereas discretionary spending is a periodic appropriation that is not allocated if no new agreement is reached. We show that discretionary only and mandatory only institutions typically lead to dynamic inefficiency and that mandatory only institutions can even lead to static inefficiency. By introducing appropriate flexibility in mandatory programs, we obtain static and dynamic efficiency. This flexibility is provided by an endogenous choice of mandatory and discretionary programs, sunset provisions and state-contingent mandatory programs in increasingly complex environments.},

@article{Abreu1988,
abstract = {This paper presents a systematic framework for studying infinitely repeated games with discounting, focussing on pure strategy (subgame) perfect equilibria. It introduces a number of concepts which organize the theory in a natural way. These include the idea of an optimal penal code, and the related notions of simple penal codes and simple strategy profiles. I view a strategy profile as a rule specifying an initial path (i.e., an infinite stream of one-period action profiles), and punishments (also paths, and hence infinite streams) for any deviations from the initial path, or from a previously prescribed punishment. An arbitrary strategy profile may involve an infinity of punishments and complex history-dependent prescriptions. The main result of this paper is that much of this potential strategic complexity is redundant: every perfect equilibrium path is the outcome of some perfect simple strategy profile. A simple strategy profile is independent of history in the following strong sense: it specifies the same player specific punishment after any deviation by a particular player. Thus simple strategy profiles have a parsimonious description in terms of (n+1) paths where n is the number of players. Unlike the undiscounted case there is no need to "make the punishment fit the crime." In particular, a player who has a "myopic" incentive to deviate from his own punishment may be deterred from doing so simply by restarting the punishment already in effect. The key to the above result is that, with discounting, worst perfect equilibria exist for each player. These define an optimal penal code. The notion of a simple penal code yields an elementary proof of the existence of an optimal penal code and leads directly to the theorem on the "sufficiency" of simple strategy profiles.},

abstract = {No-arbitrage is the fundamental principle of economic rationality which unifies normative decision theory, game theory, and market theory. In economic environments where money is available as a medium of measurement and exchange, no-arbitrage is synonymous with subjective expected utility maximization in personal decisions, competitive equilibria in capital markets and exchange economies, and correlated equilibria in noncooperative games. The arbitrage principle directly characterizes rationality at the market level; the appearance of deliberate optimization by individual agents is a consequence of their adaptation to the market. Concepts of equilibrium behavior in games and markets can thus be reconciled with the ideas that individual rationality is bounded, that agents use evolutionarily-shaped decision rules rather than numerical optimization algorithms, and that personal probabilities and utilities are inseparable and to some extent indeterminate. Risk-neutral probability distributions, interpretable as products of probabilities and marginal utilities, play a central role as observable quantities in economic systems. {\textcopyright} 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

Governments provide goods and services directly, redistribute income, and regulate economic relations. The chapter reviews recent recommendations for the institutional reform of the budgetary process. The new political economy is concerned with the most basic question of economic policy: It discusses the circumstances where markets or governments are preferred as the institution for allocating societal resources. The new political economy is the sophistication of analytic technique. The voting process can protect against dictatorship but generally at the cost of social efficiency. In Western societies, the decision has been made to protect democracy; the task then is to search for the most efficient collective choice process consistent with this norm. The results of this examination emerge in the new quantitative political economy and the empirical examination of government spending, taxation, and regulation.},

Allowing for lotteries, contracts with random components, we first establish that an adverse-selection insurance economy, a moral-hazard insurance economy, a signaling economy, and a private-information labor market economy are all special cases of a simple, general structure. We then show that techniques for characterizing Pareto optimal contracts as solutions to concave programming problems are useful and nice and appear to be broadly applicable; allowing for lotteries, we show how to characterize the optimal allocations for the adverse-selection insurance and labor market economies. We then show that standard existence and optimality theorems for competitive equilibria apply in the linear space containing lotteries if agents with characteristics which are distinct and privately observed at the time of initial trading enter the economy-wide resource constraints in a homogeneous way (other kinds of diversity are not critical). For economies with moral hazard which satisfy the homogeneity condition, competitive contract markets single out a subset of the optima and thus can be consistent with apparent unemployment and with a random allocation of labor supplied though all households are averse to risk. The adverse-selection insurance and signaling economies, however, do not satisfy the homogeneity condition and are difficult to decentralize efficiently with a price system.},

abstract = {Although recent economics contributions represent important strides forward in the understanding of leadership behavior, the cognitive and symbolic dimensions of the phenomenon have attracted virtually no interest from economists and game theorists. I argue that an understanding of these dimensions may be founded on coordination games, particularly to the extent that these illustrate interactive belief formation. In this context leadership is defined as the taking of actions that coordinate the complementary actions of many people through the creation of belief conditions that substitute for common knowledge and where these actions characteristically consists of some act of communication directed at those being led. The concept of common knowledge (or its approximation by means of notions of common belief) is argued to be particularly important to understanding leadership. Thus, leaders may establish common knowledge conditions, and assist the coordination of strategies in this way, or make decisions in situations where coordination problems persist in spite of common knowledge.},

@article{Nau1992JointCoherence,
abstract = {Decisions are often made under conditions of uncertainty about the actions of supposedly-rational competitors. The modeling of optimal behavior under such conditions is the subject of noncooperative game theory, of which a cornerstone is Harsanyi's formulation of games of incomplete information. In an incomplete-information game, uncertainty may surround the attributes as well as the strategic intentions of opposing players. Harsanyi develops the concept of a Bayesian equilibrium, which is a Nash equilibrium of a game in which the players' reciprocal beliefs about each others' attributes are consistent with a common prior distribution, as though they had been jointly drawn at random from populations with commonly-known proportions of types. The relation of such game-theoretic solution concepts to subjective probability theory and nonstrategic decision analysis has been controversial, as reflected in critiques by Kadane and Larkey and responses from Harsanyi, Shubik, and others, which have appeared in this journal. This paper shows that the Bayesian equilibrium concept and common prior assumption can be reconciled with a subjective view of probability by (i) supposing that players elicit each others' probabilities and utilities through the acceptance of gambles, and (ii) invoking a multi-agent extension of de Finetti's axiom of coherence (no arbitrage opportunities, a.k.a. "Dutch books"). However, the Nash property of statistical independence between players is weakened, and the probability distributions characterizing a solution of the game admit novel interpretations.

It is shown that there exists an equilibrium which has qualitatively different properties from those in standard real option games driven by common stochastic shocks. The properties of the equilibrium are four-fold: (i) preemption does not necessarily occur, (ii) if preemption takes place, the rent-equalization property holds, (iii) for almost all sample paths it is clear ex-ante which player invests first, and (iv) it is possible that both players invest simultaneously, even if that is not optimal. It is argued from simulations that real option games with a common one-dimensional shock do not provide a good approximation for games with player-specific uncertainty, even if these are highly correlated. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@unpublished{Penta2018,
abstract = {We study the strategic impact of players' higher order uncertainty over whether their actions are observable to their opponents. We characterize the predictions of Rationality and Common Belief in Rationality (RCBR) which are 'robust' in the sense that they do not depend on the restrictions on players' infinite order beliefs over the extensive form (that is, the observability of actions). We show that RCBR is generically unique, and that its robust predictions often support a robust refinement of rationalizability. For instance, in unanimity games, the robust predictions of RCBR rule out any inefficient equilibrium action; in zero-sum games, they support the maxmin solution, resolving a classical tension between RCBR and the maxmin logic; in common interest games, RCBR generically ensures efficient coordination of behavior, thereby showing that higher order uncertainty over the extensive form serves as a mechanism for equilibrium coordination on purely eductive grounds. We also characterize the robust predictions in settings with asynchronous moves, but in which the second mover does not necessarily observe the first mover's action. In these settings, higher order uncertainty over the observability of the earlier choice yields particularly sharp results: in 'Nash-commitment games', for instance, RCBR generically selects the equilibrium of the static game which is most favorable to the earlier mover. This means that a first-mover advantage arises whenever higher-order beliefs do not rule out that it might exist, even if the earlier mover's action is not observable. Hence, in the presence of extensive form uncertainty, timing alone may detemine the attribution of the strategic advantage, independent of the actual observability of choices.},

Why do such policies persist over long periods of time, even if they are known to be socially wasteful and better alternatives exist? And, why do certain wasteful policies eventually get repealed, while others endure? The authors examine these questions through familiar policies in contemporary American politics, but also draw on examples from around the world and throughout history. Assuming that incentives drive people's decisions, the book matches up three key ingredients—ideas, rules, and incentives—with the characters who make political waves: madmen in authority (such as Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Margaret Thatcher), intellectuals (like Jon Stewart and George Will), and academic scribblers (in the vein of Friedrich Hayek and John Maynard Keynes). Political change happens when these characters notice holes in the structure of ideas, institutions, and incentives, and then act as entrepreneurs to shake up the status quo.},

Segmenting businesses into industries with high– and low–starting capital requirements, we find no evidence that wealth matters more for businesses requiring higher initial capital. When using inheritances as an instrument for wealth, we find that both past and future inheritances predict current business entry, showing that inheritances capture more than simply liquidity. We further exploit the regional variation in house prices and find that households that lived in regions in which housing prices appreciated strongly were no more likely to start a business than households in other regions.},

An example of this system is constructed in which there is class stability. Agents who are initially close interact strongly while those who are socially distant have little interaction. In this example inherited social position, which may be interpreted as social class, plays a dominant role. The relevance of this model to social decisions such as the choice of educational attainment and childbearing is discussed in the context of specific ethnographic examples.

It is shown that there are multiple steady-state rational expectations equilibria, with all non-corner solution equilibria inefficient.

@article{Kamenica2011BayesianPersuasion,
abstract = {When is it possible for one person to persuade another to change her action? We consider a symmetric information model where a sender chooses a signal to reveal to a receiver, who then takes a noncontractible action that affects the welfare of both players. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a signal that strictly benefits the sender. We characterize sender-optimal signals. We examine comparative statics with respect to the alignment of the sender's and the receiver's preferences. Finally, we apply our results to persuasion by litigators, lobbyists, and salespeople.

@article{Reny2004OnAuctions,
abstract = {We establish the existence of pure strategy equilibria in monotone bidding functions in first-price auctions with asymmetric bidders, interdependent values, and affiliated one-dimensional signals. By extending a monotonicity result due to Milgrom and Weber (1982), we show that single crossing can fail only when ties occur at winning bids or when bids are individually irrational. We avoid these problems by considering limits of ever finer finite bid sets such that no two bidders have a common serious bid, and by recalling that single crossing is needed only at individually rational bids. Two examples suggest that our results cannot be extended to multidimensional signals or to second-price auctions.},

@article{Azevedo2016,
abstract = {This paper develops a price-theoretic framework for matching markets with heterogeneous preferences. The model departs from the standard Gale and Shapley (1962) model by assuming that a finite number of agents on one side (colleges or firms) are matched to a continuum mass of agents on the other side (students or workers). We show that stable matchings correspond to solutions of supply and demand equations, with the selectivity of each college playing a role similar to prices. We show that, very generally, the continuum model has a unique stable matching, which varies continuously with the underlying fundamentals. Moreover, stable matchings in the continuum model are the limit of the set of stable matchings in large discrete economies, so that the continuum model is an approximation of the standard Gale and Shapley model in markets where agents on one side are matched to many agents on the other side. We apply the model to an analysis of how competition induced by school choice gives schools incentives to invest in different aspects of quality. As another application, we characterize the asymptotics of school choice mechanisms.},
