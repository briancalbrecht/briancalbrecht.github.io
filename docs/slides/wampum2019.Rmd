Wampum was Colonial Money
====================================
.left-column[
- Know to economists as a **colonial money**
  -E.g., `r Citet(myBib, "Friedman1951", "Samuelson1951")`

- Today: money = medium of exchange

- Shells were broken into beads and strung into belts

- Legal tender in New Netherlands (New York)

- Official exchange rate in Massachusetts Bay Colony

Wampum was **NOT** Iroquois Money
====================================

.left-column[
- Contrary to Friedman, Samuelson, etc, the Iroquois **did not use wampum as a money**

- Recent archaeologists: `r Citet(myBib, "Tooker1978", "Snyderman1954")`

- Yet, why was wampum “the magnet which drew the beaver out”? `r Citep(myBib, "Weeden1884")`
    
- Today's talk lays out and partially resolves some puzzles about wampum as money and non-money

---
Two Themes of Today's Talk
====================================

### Monetary Case Study (Expanded for Today)

- Non-monetary society forced into contact with monetary society

- Certain people can use a good as money even if others do not

- If not as money, why was wampum valuable to Iroquois?

--

### Wampum as Institution (Circulated Draft)

- Wampum fostered peaceful cooperation and the division of labor without resorting to a sovereign to enforce agreements

- But rigid institutions that fail to adapt can go from beneficial to harmful

# Wampum as Colonial Money

---
New Netherlands 
========================

- Well-documented that wampum was medium of exchange within New Netherlands

- Director Willem Kieft started to pay employees and debts

- For Dutch, fiat money with no intrinsic value

--

- Wampum vital to economic development:

.center["high value given wampum by the Iroquois that created wealth for the Europeans and colonials, that underlay colonial ‘confidence’ in this unusual shell bead coinage, and that contributed finally to the success of colonial expansion." - `r Citet(myBib, "Ceci1982")`]



---
Gresham's Law Aside
========================

- Exchange rate to local currency was fixed

- Ordinance that outlawed unpolished wampum, because that was all that circulated

- By 1641 the different grades of wampum had created an inequity in the exchange system

- A special ruling had to be passed differentiating good and bad (worn or loose) wampum,
  - 4 good vs. 6 worn wampum to a Dutch stiver `r Citep(myBib, "Herman1956")`

- But focusing within the colonies starts the story at the end

---
Medium of Exchange in Fur Trade
========================

- Wampum was produce by Algonquian tribe, consumed by Iroquois

- No evidence of trade between Algonquians and Iroquois, although they were in contact
  - Zero coincidence of wants

- The arrival of Europeans
  - Created single coincidence of wants
  
- Wampum overcame the issue of single coincidence of wants

- Near perfect example of Menger, `r Citet(myBib, "Kiyotaki1989")`

---
Why Wampum?
=======================
Standard characteristics of a good medium of exchange

- Durable

- Divisible

- Recognizable

- Easy to transport

---
Atypical Money
===========================

- Only Europeans used as a general medium of exchange
  1. International trade
  2. Domestic

- Never became money for Iroquois (unlike Germanic barbarians with Romans)

- From the Iroquois, it was a barter-type exchange: $$\text{Furs} \Longleftrightarrow \text{Wampum}$$

- “white man fooled himself into believing wampum was Indian money”- `r Citet(myBib, "Snyderman1954")`

- Monetary story could stop there, as monetary oddity

---
Value to Iroquois
=========================

- Whole trade system relied on the Iroquois valuing wampum extremely highly

- “the most precious article they possess” -`r Citet(myBib, "Tremblay2006")`

- “I suppose your Honors sent them [copper kettles] here for the French Indians, who do not want such things from us… They come to us for no other reason than to get wampum” - `r Citet(myBib, "Starna2004")`

- But why?

.left[What was Wampum to Iroquois?]
=================================

---
Wampum's Early History
=====================================

- Earliest uses go to the Condolence Council, a predecessor to the **Iroquois League**

- Upon the death of a chief, wampum was given as a gift

- Peace offering quelled political turmoil

- Condolence Council initiated The Great Peace
  - Peace among the Five Nations for over three hundred years

- “Wampum, the chief instrument of the Council, became the vehicle necessary for all important political transactions” - `r Citet(myBib, "Snyderman1954a")`



---
Institutional Roles for the Iroquois
====================================


1. Memory: the pre-literate society could “write” down their obligations

2. Screening: wampum "gifts" were costly signals to separate good trading partners from bad


---
Memory Role
==========================

- Recorded the words of the Condolence Council

- Belts were mnemonic devices, not written words

- Regularly “read” aloud and posted publicly 

- Wampum was a public record
  
- In particular, wampum established, recorded, and enforced reciprocal obligations
  - Like a debt (credit?) contract without a unit of payment
  - Cost of production limited the amount of debts created

---

# The Colonial Period



---
Screening Role
=========================


- Wampum was also a gift from one side to another
  
- Especially costly signal: 7 days of work per 6 foot belt

- Europeans had to learn and participate in an elaborate ceremony
  - Lowering social distance `r Citet(myBib, "Akerlof1997", "Leeson2008")`
  
- Nearly half of a treaty exchange involved an invitation process that colonial records describe as “trifling” and “tedious” `r Citet(myBib, "Foster1985")`

- Only patient groups pay cost to invest in long-term trade relations


---
Hold Up Problem
==========================

- After European contact, there was the added threat of violence

- At any meeting, Europeans may want to steal furs by gunpoint

- At that point in time, Europeans are holding goods that are worthless to them

- Acts as a commitment device, compared to trading furs for cloths/tools directly
  - Similar to two-stage trading in `r Citet(myBib, "Leeson2007")`

---
Institutional Shock
===================================

- However, European arrival brought European tools

- Production costs decreased by factor of ten

- Wampum production skyrockets
  - Some early anthropologists thought wampum only came after European contact

- Colonists would promise more than they would deliver 
  - Goods, protection, land

---
Institutional Importance
===================================


- Instead forest diplomacy became more important

- 18th century saw forest diplomacy’s “perfection” (Fenton 1998, 7)


---
Institutional Tragedy
===================================
 
 - An efficient system would change with the costs
  - Decreased cost => shift of supply => decreased marginal value 

- Yet, wampum and forest diplomacy continued 

- Leading to loss of the Iroquois’s last settlements in New York State `r Citep(myBib, "Foster1985")`, 100–101). 

---
Rents to Maintain???
==================================

- Middlemen or cultural brokers benefited from forest diplomacy

- Their “intermediate position, one step removed from final responsibility in decision making, occasionally allows brokers to promise more than they can deliver” - `r Citet(myBib, "Richter1988")`

- Cultural brokers could “slant speeches in ways advantageous to himself”- `r Citet(myBib, "Jennings1984")`



---
The Wampum Legacy
==================================

- Dual institutional role:
  - Money among Europeans Dutch
  - Contract/treaty between tribes and Europeans

- Wampum was an effective institution for over three hundred years for promoting cooperation

- Promoted cooperation through two roles:
  - Memory
  - Screening

- After colonial expansion, wampum became ineffective

- Yet, the Iroquois continued to rely on wampum 
  - Possible tension: Iroquois kept wampum because certain people still benefited 


---
Implications for Today
================================

--

- None
