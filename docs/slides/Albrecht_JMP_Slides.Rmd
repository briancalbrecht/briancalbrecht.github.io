- Two pure-strategy, Nash equilibria

  1. Pareto optimal, efficient investment: (Invest, Invest)
  2. Pareto dominated, **coordination failure**: (Don't Invest, Don't Invest)

--

- Both are stable, mixed strategy equilibrium is not
---
Competitive Coordination
====================================


- What if there are **many players** and they are **operating in a market**?

--

- These features matter because important real-world investments are sunk before entering a market

--

  - Invest in education before being hired
  - Produce goods before having a buyer
  - Write JMP before knowing schools want a general equilibrium theorist

--

- When investments are sunk, *i.e.* when markets are incomplete, coordination failures can arise even with competitive markets
  - Makowski & Ostroy (1995), Cole, Malaith, & Postlewaite (1999a, 1999b), Makowski (2004), N&ouml;ldeke & Samuelson (2014), Felli & Roberts (2016)

--
  
- Previous literature only studied **existence of coordination failures**



---
My Question
====================================


- Are the market investments we observe likely to be inefficient? 


- **Are coordination failures robust**?


- Should we predict coordination failures?

--

## My Answer

- **No**, if markets are competitive


- Formally, inefficient equilibria are not robust to errors in a trembling-hand refinement


$\Rightarrow$ We should predict efficient market outcomes

---
Sketch of General Environment
====================================

- Continuum of buyers and sellers, finite types

- Transferable utility

--

.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_B.png)]

???
Simple set up to focus on the coordination aspect

Ignore hold-up, bargaining issues




---
Example
====================================

- Continuum of buyers and sellers

- Buyers pick $b \in B= \{0,1\}$, sellers pick $s \in S = \{0,1\}$

- Cost to buyer = $\frac{1}{4}b$;  Cost to seller = $\frac{1}{4}s$

- Surplus $v(b,s) = bs$ of matching



  

---
Stage 2: Matching Market
===================================

- In the competitive market, every agent buys the  **contractual right** to match with another agent

- Price schedule for matches: $p : B \times S \to \mathbb{R}$

- $p(b,s)$: transfer from buyer with $b$ to seller with $s$

- Final buyer utility: $v(b,s) - p(b,s) - \frac{1}{4}b$

- Final seller utility: $p(b,s) - \frac{1}{4}s$


---
Stage 1: Decision Problem
==============================

- Agents make investment decisions based on price conjectures: $\tilde{p}^i(b,s)$
  - They take as given the contract they will buy in stage 2

- Buyer's problem

$$\max_{b'} \left\{\max_{s'}\left\{ \underbrace{v(b',s') - \tilde{p}^i(b',s')}_{\text{Contract Choice}}\right\} - \frac{1}{4}b'\right\}$$


- Seller's problem 

$$\max_{s'} \left\{\max_{b'}\left\{\underbrace{\tilde{p}^j(b',s')}_{\text{Contract Choice}}\right\} - \frac{1}{4}b'\right\}$$

---
Investment Equilibrium
====================================



1. Each buyer $i$ chooses $(b,s)$ to maximize utility, given $\tilde{p}^i(b,s)$

2. Each seller $j$ chooses $(b,s)$ to maximize utility, given $\tilde{p}^j(b,s)$

--

3. Rational conjectures: conjectures are not contradicted by the data
  - If positive mass of agents choose contract $(b,s)$, conjectures agree with the posted price: $\tilde{p}^i (b,s) = \tilde{p}^j (b,s)= p(b,s)$
  
  - Otherwise conjectures are not pinned down 

--

4. Prices clear matching markets
  - Mass of buyers choosing $(b,s)$ = mass of sellers choosing $(b,s)$

  
???
Informal Definition

---
Example Payoffs
=====================================

.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_G.png)]

--
- Prices and conjectures are endogenous

- Rational conjectures: if a match $(b,s)$ is chosen, $\tilde{p}^i (b,s) = \tilde{p}^j (b,s)= p(b,s)$

- Equilibrium does not require optimization or correct conjectures "off-path" (like Nash)

???
We need to find conjectures and prices
---

Constructing Equilibria
====================================

- Efficient equilibrium: $b=s=1$

  - Suppose realized prices: $p(1,1)= \frac{1}{2}$
  - Non-contradicting conjectures: $\tilde{p}^i = \tilde{p}^j = 0$ otherwise
    
--

- Coordination failure: $b=s=0$

  - Realized prices: $p(0,0)=0$
  - **Contradicting** conjectures: 
      - To prevent buyer deviating: $\tilde{p}^i (1,1) \geq \frac{3}{4}$
      - To prevent seller deviating: $\tilde{p}^j(1,1) \leq \frac{1}{4}$

--

- What are the efficiency implications?
  - Max or min feasible surplus

???
SLOW SLOW SLOW



---
Refinement
=======================


- Multiplicity from a Nash-style equilibrium


- But one equilibria relies on off-path conjectures as a free parameter
  - Theorist can pick $\tilde{p}^j(b,s)$ discourage all other actions
  - Ignored by previous theorists

- I consider a mild refinement to avoid this free belief parameter
  - Trembling-hand perfection

- Show which equilibria are robust/stable to small mistakes

???
Robert Lucas taught us to beware of theorists bearing free parameters

---
Perturbed Strategies
====================================

- For simplicity, assume

1. Symmetric trembling hand at investment stage: 
  - Each attribute must be chosen with positive probability $\epsilon^i>0$ by each buyer and seller

1. In the aggregate each attribute must be chosen by a positive density of players

--

- Perfect equilibrium: limit of some sequence $\to 0$ of $\epsilon = (\epsilon^i,\epsilon^j)$

- **Claim**: The unique perfect equilibrium allocation is efficient

???
Symmetric: all players and all actions have same tremble
---
Uniqueness Proof
==========

- With trembling hand, each $b$ and $s$ are played $\Rightarrow$ $\tilde{p}^i(b,s) = \tilde{p}^j(b,s) = p(b,s)$


- For simplicity, fix price at zero for all besides markets besides $(1,1)$


---
Example Payoffs
=====================================

.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_H.png)]

---
Uniqueness Proof
==========

- If $p(1,1)$ is low $(< \frac{3}{4})$, no buyers want to choose $b=0$ 

  - Instead, choose $b=1$ as much as possible: $1 - \epsilon^i$
  - Drives $p(1,1)$ up
  
--

- If $p(1,1)$ is high $(> \frac{1}{4})$, no sellers want to choose $s=0$

  - Instead choose $s=1$ as much as possible: $1 - \epsilon^j$
  - Drives $p(1,1)$ down


--
- $p(1,1) \in \left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]$


---

# $p(1,1) \in \left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]$

.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_I.png)]


---
Uniqueness Proof
==========

- For any tremble, some $p(1,1) \in \left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]$ balances supply and demand and clears all markets

- At that price, everyone wants to invest

--


- For any $\epsilon \to 0$, $(1,1)$ is the unique equilibrium strategy profile


---
Take-aways from Example
==============================

1. Coordination failures can exist with competition

2. However, coordination failures are sustained by contradictory conjectures

3. Mistakes/trembles eliminates contradictions $\Rightarrow$ no coordination failures

4. [All perfect, competitive equilibria are efficient](#fulltalk)


---
Extending the Result
================================

- **Main Theorem**: for a general class of matching models with investments, all *perfect* investment equilibria are efficient

--

  - Single type $\Rightarrow$ general finite types, $\beta(i),\sigma (j)$
  
  - $B=S= \{0,1\} \Rightarrow$ general investment levels
  
  - $\frac{1}{4}b, \frac{1}{4}s \Rightarrow$ general cost of investment that can depend on types, $c\left(\beta(i), b\right)$ and $c\left(\sigma (j), s\right)$
  
  - $v(b,s) =b s \Rightarrow$ general surplus function 


---
Structure of General Proof
================================

- General buyers' problem: $\max_b v(b,s) - \tilde{p}^i (b,s) - c\left(\beta(i), b\right)~~~\forall i$

--

- General sellers' problem: $\max_s  \tilde{p}^j (b,s)  - c\left(\sigma (j), s\right)~~~\forall j$


--

- Total welfare

$$\int_i  \left[\max_b v(b,s) - \tilde{p}^i (b,s) - c\left(\beta(i), b\right)\right] di  + \int_j \left[\max_s  \tilde{p}^j (b,s)  - c\left(\sigma (j), s\right)\right] dj.$$

--

- Efficiency

$$\max_{b,s} \int_i  v(b,s)  - c\left(\beta(i), b\right) di  + \int_j  - c\left(\sigma (j), s\right) dj.$$

--

- With common conjectures for all players, total welfare = efficiency  $\blacksquare$

---
  Not *So* Simple
====================================

As in any theory paper, technical complications arise, *e.g.* I need to


1. Model an explicit Walrasian, matching market, given fixed investments, compared to picking a match ex ante

1. Integrate the non-cooperative investment stage with a Walrasian matching market

1. Define a tremble and perfect equilibrium with a continuum of players


- [Example highlights the core ideas](#conclusion)

====================================
1. Example


2. **General Matching Model**

  - Competitive Equilibria with Fixed Investments
  - Conditional Efficiency

3. Investment Game where Players Choose Attributes

  - Investment Equilibria
  - Perfect Investment Equilibria
  - Efficiency




---
Stage 1: Types
====================================
- Buyer names: $i \in I$ $~~~~$ Seller names: $j \in J$

- Finite Types: $\beta : I \to \mathcal{B}$ $~~~~$  $\sigma : J \to \mathcal{S}$

- Possible types: $t \in T = \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{S}$

- Economy: a positive measure on $T$: $$E \in M_+(T)$$



---
Stage 1: Attributes
====================================
- Each individual must acquire/invest in one attribute  $A$

- $A$ is partitioned into attributes that are feasible for buyers $B$ and feasible for sellers $S$

- Type determines cost of acquiring attribute $$c : T \times A \to \mathbb{R} \cup {\infty}$$

- $c(t,a)$ is the cost of acquiring $a$ for type $t$

--

- Individual choices lead to distribution of attributes $\mu \in M_+(A)$

- For any attribute $a \subset A$, $\mu(E)$ is the mass of individuals with attribute $a$

---
Stage 2: Matching Game
====================================

- Bounded value function: $v : B^{\emptyset} \times S^{\emptyset} \to \mathbb{R}$

- Competitive prices: $p : B^{\emptyset} \times S^{\emptyset} \to \mathbb{R}$ 

- To allow individuals to remain unmatched, let $B^{\emptyset} \equiv B \cup {0}$ and $S^{\emptyset} \equiv S \cup {0}$

- A matching is a measure $$x \in M_+ (B^{\emptyset} \times S^{\emptyset})$$

- A matching $x$ is **feasible** for $\mu$ if $x(0,0)=0$, and for all attributes,
$$x(b, S^{\emptyset}) = \mu(b)$$
$$x(B^{\emptyset}, s) = \mu(s)$$






  
---
Stage 2: Equilibrium
====================================


<font color=#125972><b>Definition:</b></font> The pair $(x,p)$ is an (ex post) **competitive equilibrium** for $\mu$ if $x$ is feasible for $\mu$, $p(b,\emptyset)= p(\emptyset,s) \equiv 0$,
--

- For each $b \in  \text{ supp } \mu$ and each $(b,s^*) \in \text{ supp } x,$
the match maximizes $b$'s utility:

--

$$s^* \in \text{ argmax }_{s} \left\{\max_{s' \in \text{ supp }  S}\left\{ v(b,s') - p(b,s')\right\}, v(b, \emptyset)\right\},$$
--

- For each $s \in  \text{ supp } \mu$ and each $(b^*,s) \in \text{ supp } x$, the match maximizes $s$'s utility:
--

$$b^* \in \text{ argmax }_{b}\left\{ \max_{b' \in \text{ supp } B} \left\{p(b',s)\right\}, v(\emptyset,s)\right\}.$$

???
Walk slowly through each


---
Stage 2: Efficiency
====================================

 

- Social matching gains function given $\mu$
$$g(\mu) \equiv \text{max}_{x} \sum_{b \in B^{\emptyset}} \sum_{s \in S^{\emptyset}} v(b,s) x(b,s)~~~ s.t. x \text{ is feasible given } \mu$$
- An allocation that attains $g(\mu)$ is **conditionally efficient**


---
Stage 2: Efficiency
====================================
- **Conditional First Welfare Theorem**:  If a pair $(x,p)$ is competitive for $\mu$, then it is conditionally efficient

- It is conditional because maximization only holds within the support

- $\mu$ may be missing the efficient $b$ and $s$

- Given the choice in a non-cooperative setting, do people choose the efficient $b$ and $s$?

  - Competitive Equilibria with Fixed Investments
  - Conditional Efficiency

3. **Investment Game where Players Choose Atrributes**

  - Investment Equilibria
  - Perfect Investment Equilibria
  - Efficiency

---
Stage 1: Attributes
====================================

- Fix the ex ante population $E$

- An allocation of attributes is a measure $\nu \in M_+(A\times T)$
  - Marginals: $\nu_{A}, \nu_T$
  - $\mu = \nu_{A}$
  
- An allocation $\nu$ is *feasible* for $E$ if $\nu_T = E$

- Each agent $i$ has price conjectures: $\tilde{p} : B^{\emptyset} \times S^{\emptyset} \to \mathbb{R}$

---
Conjectured Indirect Utility
====================================

- Define conjectured indirect utility of matching


- Buyer $b$ who conjectures $\tilde{p}$

$$v^*_b(\tilde{p}) = \max_{s} \left\{\max_{s' \in \text{ supp }  S}\left\{ v(b,s') - \tilde{p}^i(b,s')\right\}, v(b, \emptyset)\right\}$$
- Seller $s$ who conjectures $\tilde{p}$

$$v^*_s(\tilde{p}) = \max_{b}\left\{ \max_{b' \in \text{ supp } B} \left\{p(b',s)\right\}, v(\emptyset,s)\right\}$$


---
Equilibrium
====================================

- A pair $(\nu, p)$ is an **investment equilibrium** for $E$ if $\nu$ is feasible, $(x,p)$ is a competitive equilibrium for $\nu_A$,

Buyers optimize their investment: for all $(t,b) \in \text{supp } \nu$


$$v_b^*(\tilde{p}) - c(t,b) \geq v^*_{b'}(p) - c(t,b') ~~~\forall b' \in B$$


Sellers optimize: for all $(s,t) \in \text{supp } \nu$

$$v_s^*(\tilde{p}) - c(s,t) \geq v^*_{s'}(p) - c(s',t) ~~~\forall s' \in s$$


Rational conjectures: $$\tilde{p}(b,s) = p(b,s) ~~\forall (b,s) \in \text{ supp } x$$


---
Efficiency
====================================

- Total cost of attributes $\nu$ is $\sum_A \sum_T c(t,a) \nu(t,a).$

- Total surplus from $\nu$ is
$$G(\nu) = g(\nu_{A}) - \sum_A \sum_T c(t,a) \nu(t,a).$$

- The allocation $\nu$ is unconditionally **efficient** for $E$ if it is feasible and $G(\nu) \geq G(\nu')$ for all other feasible allocation $\nu'$


---
Unconstrained Beliefs
====================================

- Without more structure, there will often be many equilibria

- Suppose not matching is generates no value generation: $v(\emptyset,s)=v(b,\emptyset)=0$
  - Often assumed in buyer/seller markets
  
- $b=0, s=0$ can be part of an equilibrium through appropriate conjectures
  - No matter how large $v(b,s)$ is, sellers can still rationally conjecture that $p(b,s)=0$

--

- Weakness of Nash equilibrium: 
  - In this class of matching games, the surplus maximizing **and minimizing** outcomes can occur


---
Need for Refinement
====================================

- Off-path beliefs are a free parameter

- Why would sellers conjecture $p(1,1) = 0$?

--

- Economists have recognized this issue in other competitive contexts:

  - Zame (2007) - "imposing no discipline would admit equilibria which are **viable only because different agents hold contradictory beliefs**"

--

  - Gale (1992) - "Typically, there exists a large number of equilibria and **some refinement of the equilibrium concept is required to give the theory predictive power**. One such refinement is based on the notion of the 'trembling' hand."


---
Perturbations
====================================

- Consider a perturbed strategy vector for all buyers $i \in I$, $\epsilon_B = (\epsilon(b))_{b \in B},$ satisfying  $\epsilon(b)>0$ for all $b \in B$ and 
$$\sum_B \epsilon(b) \leq 1$$
- For all sellers $\epsilon_S = (\epsilon(s))_{s \in S},$ satisfying  $\epsilon(s)>0$ for all $s \in S$ and 
$$\sum_S \epsilon(s) \leq 1$$

- A perturbed game is indexed by the vector of perturbed strategies $\epsilon = (\epsilon_B,\epsilon_S)$

---
$\epsilon$-Investment Equilibria
====================================

- An allocation $\nu(\epsilon)$ is $\epsilon$-feasible for $E$ if  $\nu_T = E$ and for all $a \in A$
$$\nu_{A}(\epsilon(a)) \geq \epsilon(a)$$

- A pair $(\nu(\epsilon), p)$ is an $\epsilon$-investment equilibrium for $E$ if $\nu$ is $\epsilon$-feasible, $p$ is a competitive price for $\nu_T$, and for all $(t,a)$ such that $\nu_{A}(\epsilon) > \epsilon$,

$$v_a^*(p) - c(t,a) \geq v^*_{a'}(p) - c(a',t) ~~~\forall a' \in A$$

--

- Note that by construction, $\text{ supp } \nu_{A}(\epsilon) = A$

--

- A pair $(\nu,p)$ is a **perfect investment equilibria** if there exists a sequence of $\epsilon$, such that $\lim_{k \to \infty} M(\epsilon^k)=0$ such that $(\nu(\epsilon^k),p) \to (\nu,p)$.

---
Restricted Efficiency
====================================
- The allocation $\nu(\epsilon)$ is $\epsilon$-efficient for $E$ if it is feasible and $G(\nu(\epsilon)) \geq G(\nu'(\epsilon))$ for all other $\epsilon$-feasible allocation $\nu'$

- **Lemma 1**: If $(\nu(\epsilon), p)$ is an $\epsilon$-investment equilibrium, then it is $\epsilon$-efficient.

--

- Proof: 

 Let $Q(\epsilon)$ be the utility generated by the trembling actions
 $$Q(\epsilon)=\int_i \left\{ \sum_b  \left[v^*_b(p) - c(\beta{i},b)\right]\epsilon(b)\right\} di  + \int_j\left\{\sum_{s} \left[v^*_b(p) - c(\sigma{j},s)\right]\epsilon(s)\right\} dj.$$


---
Proof (continued)
====================================

- Hence, 

$$\underbrace{\left(\int  \left[\max_b v(b,s) - \tilde{p}^i (b,s) - c\left(\beta(i), b\right)\right] di  + \int\left[\max_s  \tilde{p}^j (b,s)  - c\left(\sigma(j), s\right)\right] dj\right) \left(1 - \sum_a \epsilon(a) \right)}_{\text{Optimized Choice}}$$
$$ + \underbrace{Q(\epsilon)}_{\text{Constrained Choice}}$$

- But since all actions are played by trembles, $\tilde{p}^i(b,s) =\tilde{p}^j(b,s)$ 

- Therefore they optimize the entire left expression

- It is looks exactly like a static problem, which is efficient $\qquad \blacksquare$


---
Full Efficiency
====================================

- **Theorem**: If $(\nu, p)$ is a perfect investment equilibrium, then it is efficient.

--

- Proof: 

 Immediate from Lemma 1, since  $\underbrace{Q(\epsilon)}_{\text{Constrained Choice}} \to 0$ $\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \blacksquare$
 


---
name:conclusion
Common Conjectures Justifications
====================================

- Predictive power comes from imposing more restrictions on beliefs than just rational expectations

- Trembling hand + continuum $\Rightarrow$ as-if complete markets

- Complete markets means rational expectations $\Rightarrow$ common conjectures 

--

- Other approaches:
  - Dubey and Geanakoplos (2002): fictitious seller who contributes an infinitesimal to each health insurance pool
  
  - Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik (2005): government intervenes to sell infinitesimal quantities of each asset and fully delivers on its promises
  
  - Zame (2007): only considers "common-belief" equilibria


---
Conclusion
====================================

- Under competition, coordination failures rely on using beliefs as a free parameter and constructing overly pessimistic conjectures

- Free parameter $\Rightarrow$ many equilibria

- If we want predictive power, we must use a refinement

- I use trembling-hand perfection

THP Equilibria Need Not Be Efficient
====================================

- Consider the following 2x2 game

.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_A.png)]

- (Up, Left) is the unique THP equilibrium

- Selten (1975)'s original, extensive-form example is inefficient


---
Price-Taking Solves Hold-up
====================================

- With a hold-up problem, sellers may worry she faces a buyer that is a very tough bargainer

- The transfer to seller may not cover investment cost: $p(1,1)<\frac{1}{4}$

- In that case, sellers want to invest as little as possible

- Price-taking ensures $p(1,1) \in \left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]$

$\Rightarrow$ each side wants to invest as much as possible
