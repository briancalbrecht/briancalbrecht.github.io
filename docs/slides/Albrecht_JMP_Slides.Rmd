- Two pure-strategy, Nash equilibria

  1. Pareto optimal, efficient investment: (Invest, Invest)
  2. Pareto dominated, **coordination failure**: (Don't Invest, Don't Invest)

--

- Both pure-strategy are stable; mixed-strategy is not

---
Competitive Coordination
====================================


- What if there are **many players** and they are **operating in a market**?

--

- These features matter because important real-world investments are sunk before entering a market with many players

--

  - Invest in education before being hired
  - Produce goods before having a buyer
<!---  - Write JMP before knowing schools want a general equilibrium theorist --->

--

- When investments are sunk, *i.e.* when markets are incomplete, coordination failures can arise even with competitive markets
  - Makowski & Ostroy (1995), Cole, Malaith, & Postlewaite (1999a, 1999b), Makowski (2004), N&ouml;ldeke & Samuelson (2014), Felli & Roberts (2016)

--
  
- Previous literature only studied **existence of coordination failures**



---
My Question
====================================


- Are the market investments we observe likely to be inefficient? 


- **Are coordination failures robust**?


- Should we predict coordination failures?

--

## My Answer

- **No**, if markets are competitive


- Formally, inefficient equilibria are not robust to errors in a trembling-hand refinement


$\Rightarrow$ We should predict efficient market outcomes

---
Mechanism
====================================

- In competitive markets, players only care about **prices**

--

- To not invest, software entreprenuer must conjecture he would get paid less than 1 if she invests

- To not invest, hardware entreprenuer must conjecture she would get paid less than 1 if she invests

--

- **Somebody must be wrong*

- Conjectures must contradict for any coordination failure

- But disagreement is not robust to a trembling hand

Sketch of General Environment
====================================

- Continuum of buyers and sellers, finite types

- Transferable utility

--

.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_B.png)]

???
Simple set up to focus on the coordination aspect

Ignore hold-up, bargaining issues




---
Example
====================================

- Agents are endowed with a type $t \in T = \{\beta, \sigma\}$: "buyer" or "seller"

  - Measure one of both

- Buyers choose an investment $b \in B= \{0,1\}$

- Sellers choose an investment $s \in S = \{0,1\}$

--

- Cost to buyer = $\frac{1}{4}b$

- Cost to seller = $\frac{1}{4}s$

- Surplus $v(b,s) = bs$ of matching



  

---
Stage 2: Matching Market
===================================


- A buyer $b$ chooses a **match contract** $(b,s) \in \left\{(b,0) , (b,1)\right\}$ guaranteeing the right to join a match with $s$

- A seller $s$ chooses $(b,s) \in \left\{(0,s) , (1,s)\right\}$

--

- Matches have competitive prices: $p : B \times S \to \mathbb{R}$

- $p(b,s)$: transfer from buyer with $b$ to seller with $s$


--

- Matching market indirect utility for $b$:

$$v^*_b(p) = \max_{s}\left\{ v(b,s) - p(b,s) \right\}$$

--

- Matching market indirect utility for $s$:

$$v^*_s(p) = \max_{b}\left\{ p(b,s) \right\}$$


---
Stage 1: Decision Problem
==============================


- Agents only have **price conjectures**: $\tilde{p}^t : B \times S \to \mathbb{R} \quad \forall t \in \{\beta,\sigma\}$
  
  - Not a distribution but can think of conjectures = expected price
    
--

- Buyer's investment problem: $$\max_{b} \left\{\underbrace{ v^*_b\left(\tilde{p}^\beta\right)}_{\text{Utility from Conjectured Optimal Contract}}  - \underbrace{\frac{1}{4}b}_{\text{Investment Cost}}\right\}$$

--

- Seller's investment problem: $\max_{s} \left\{ v^*_s\left(\tilde{p}^\sigma\right)  - \frac{1}{4}s\right\}$

---
Investment Equilibrium
====================================

Equilibrium is a vector of matches, prices, and conjectures, such that

--

1. Each buyer chooses $(b,s)$ to maximize utility, given $\tilde{p}^\beta(b,s)$

2. Each seller chooses $(b,s)$ to maximize utility, given $\tilde{p}^\sigma(b,s)$

--

3. Prices clear matching markets
  - Mass of buyers choosing $(b,s)$ = mass of sellers choosing $(b,s)$

--

4. Rational conjectures: conjectures are not contradicted by the data
  - If positive mass of agents choose contract $(b,s)$, conjectures agree with the posted price: $\tilde{p}^\beta (b,s)=\tilde{p}^\sigma (b,s)= p(b,s)$
  
  - If zero mass choose $(b,s)$, conjectures are not pinned down 

???
Informal Definition

---
Payoffs
=====================================

.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_G.png)]

--
- Prices and conjectures are equilibrium objects

- Rational conjectures: if a match $(b,s)$ is chosen, $\tilde{p}^\beta (b,s)= \tilde{p}^\sigma (b,s)= p(b,s)$

- Allows disagreement for matches that do not occur

???
We need to find conjectures and prices


---

Constructing Equilibria
====================================

- Efficient equilibrium: everyone invests

  - Suppose realized prices: $p(1,1)= \frac{1}{2}$
  - Conjectures: $\tilde{p}^\beta = \tilde{p}^\sigma = 0$ otherwise

Constructing Equilibria
====================================

- Efficient equilibrium: everyone invests

  - Suppose realized prices: $p(1,1)= \frac{1}{2}$
  - Conjectures: $\tilde{p}^\beta = \tilde{p}^\sigma = 0$ otherwise
    

- Coordination failure: no one invests

  - Suppose realized prices: $p(0,0)=0$
  - Conjectures: 
      - Buyers: $\tilde{p}^\beta (1,1) = 1$
      - Sellers: $\tilde{p}^\sigma(1,1) = 0$

???
SLOW SLOW SLOW

---
Coordination Failure Payoffs
=====================================

.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_K.png)]

--

- To prevent buyer deviating: $\tilde{p}^\beta (1,1) \geq \frac{3}{4}$

- To prevent seller deviating: $\tilde{p}^\sigma(1,1) \leq \frac{1}{4}$

--

- **Result**: Every coordination involves contradictory conjectures
  - $\tilde{p}^\beta (1,1) \neq \tilde{p}^\sigma(1,1)$


???
Only optimize, given prices.

Think deeper: Need to think price will be 1 and that will clear market

---
Refinement
=======================


- Multiplicity from a Nash-style equilibrium


- But the coordination failure requires contradictory conjectures

--

- To discipline conjectures and give predictive power, I introduce a mild refinement

  - Trembling-hand perfection (Selten 1975)
  
  - Simple way to capture mistakes/experimentation

- Show which equilibria are robust/stable to small mistakes


???
Robert Lucas taught us to beware of theorists bearing free parameters

---
Perturbed Strategies
====================================

When defining trembles,

1. Symmetric trembling hand only at investment stage: 
  - Each investment must be chosen with positive probability $\epsilon(b), \epsilon(s) >0$ by each buyer and seller

1. Law of large numbers: in the aggregate each investment must be chosen by at least  $\epsilon(b)$ buyers and  $\epsilon(s)$ sellers

--

- Definition: A perfect equilibrium is limit of some sequence of equilibria for $\epsilon = (\epsilon(b),\epsilon(s)) \to (0,0)$

- **Claim**: The unique perfect equilibrium *allocation* is efficient


???
Symmetric: all players and all actions have same tremble
---
Uniqueness Proof
==========

- With trembling hand, each $b$ and $s$ are played $\Rightarrow$ $\tilde{p}^\beta(b,s) = \tilde{p}^\sigma(b,s) = p(b,s)$

- Prices are no longer a free parameter

--

- Step 1: Besides $p(1,1)$ fix all other prices a 0
  - Verify ex post this is part of equilibrium




---
Deviating from $(0,0)$
================================================


- Step 2: For $\epsilon >> 0$

.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_H.png)]

--


- For $p(1,1) > \frac{1}{4}$, all sellers choose $(1,1)$

--

- For $p(1,1) < \frac{3}{4}$. all buyers choose $(1,1)$ 

--
- $\Rightarrow$ For any price, someone wants to deviate from $(0,0)$
  - $(0,0)$ cannot be voluntarily chosen in an equilibrium



---
Supply and Demand for $(1,1)$
==========

Step 3: For any $\epsilon >> 0$, again some price $p(1,1) \in \left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]$ clears market

<!--- - At that price, everyone wants to invest if they can match --->
<!---  - $\text{min}\left\{1- \epsilon(b), 1- \epsilon(s)\right\}$ invest on both sides --->

- For every $\epsilon \to (0,0)$, the match $(1,1)$ is the unique equilibrium strategy choice $\blacksquare$

--

- However, prices are not unique
- *e.g.* if equilibrium payoffs are $\frac{1}{4}$, other prices can be in $\left[0, \frac{1}{4}\right)$

--

- Indirectly proved no mixed strategy equilibrium (endogenous trembles)
  - This is different from 2-entrepreneur example

<!--  - If someone is mixing between $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$, $p(1,1)$ is public and either buyers or sellers strictly prefer $(1,1)$ -->




---
Results for the Example
==============================

1. Inefficiencies (coordination failures) can occur under competition

2. However, coordination failures require contradictory conjectures

3. Experimentation eliminates contradictions $\Rightarrow$ no coordination failures

4. [All perfect, competitive equilibria are efficient](#fulltalk)

--

- These results hold in a general environment 
 
---
Extending the Results
================================

- **Main Theorem**: for a general class of matching models with investments, all *perfect* investment equilibria are efficient

--

  - General finite types, $\beta \in X,\sigma \in Y$
  
  - General finite investment levels
  
  - General cost of investment that can depend on types, $c\left(\beta, b\right)$ and $c\left(\sigma, s\right)$
  
  -  General surplus function $v(b,s)$


---
Structure of General Proof
================================

- General buyers' problem: $\max_{b,s} v(b,s) - \tilde{p}^\beta (b,s) - c\left(\beta, b\right)$

--

- General sellers' problem: $\max_{b,s}  \tilde{p}^\sigma (b,s)  - c\left(\sigma, s\right)$


--

- Total welfare, given measure over types $\mathcal{E}(\beta), \mathcal{E}(\sigma)$

$$\sum_\beta \left[ \max_{b,s}  v(b,s) - \tilde{p}^\beta (b,s)- c\left(\beta, b\right)\right] \mathcal{E}(\beta)  +  \sum_\sigma \left[\max_{b,s}  \tilde{p}^\sigma (b,s)  - c\left(\sigma, s\right)\right]\mathcal{E}(\sigma)$$
--

- Efficiency

$$\max_{b,s}  \left\{  \sum_\beta \left[v(b,s)  - p(b,s)- c\left(\beta, b\right)\right]\mathcal{E}(\beta) +    
  \sum_\sigma\left[p(b,s) - c\left(\sigma, s\right)\right] \mathcal{E}(\sigma)\right\}$$

--

- Since each agent is choosing both $(b,s)$, total welfare = efficiency  $\blacksquare$

---
  Not *So* Simple
====================================

As in any paper, technical complications arise, *e.g.* I need to


1. Model an explicit competitive matching market, given fixed investments, compared to picking a match ex ante

1. Integrate the non-cooperative investment stage with the competitive matching market

1. Define a tremble and perfect equilibrium with a continuum of players


- [Example highlights the core ideas](#conclusions)

Road Map for Talk
====================================
1. Example


2. **General Matching Model**

  - Competitive Equilibria with Fixed Investments
  - Conditional Efficiency

3. Investment Game where Players Choose Investments

  - Investment Equilibria
  - Perfect Investment Equilibria
  - Efficiency




---
Stage 1: Types
====================================

- General endowed types: $t \in T$

- Partitioned into 

  - Buyer endowed types: $\beta \in X$

  - Seller endowed types: $\sigma \in Y$



- Economy: a positive measure on $T$: $\mathcal{E} \in M_+(T)$



---
Stage 1: Investments
====================================

- General investments: $a \in A$

- Partitioned into

  - Buyer investments: $b \in B$
  
  - Seller investments: $s \in S$

--

- Type determines cost of acquiring investment $$c : T \times A \to \mathbb{R} \cup {\infty}$$

- $c(t,a)$ is the cost to a type $t$ of investment $a$

---
Stage 2: Matching Game Distribution
====================================

- Individual choices lead to distribution of investments $\mu \in M_+(A)$

  - Not keeping track of $M_+(T \times A)$ 

- For any investment $a$, $\mu(a)$ is the mass of individuals with investment $a$

  - Buyers: $\mu_b \in M_+(B)$
  
  - Sellers: $\mu_s \in M_+(S)$


---
Stage 2: Matching Game
====================================

- To allow individuals to remain unmatched, let $B^{\emptyset} \equiv B \cup \emptyset$ and $S^{\emptyset} \equiv S \cup \emptyset$

- Bounded value function: $v : B^{\emptyset} \times S^{\emptyset} \to \mathbb{R}$

- Competitive prices: $p : B^{\emptyset} \times S^{\emptyset} \to \mathbb{R}$
  - Normalize: $p(b,\emptyset) \equiv p(\emptyset,s) \equiv 0$

--

- Could generalize to $v(\beta,b,\sigma,s)$, if sufficient prices $p(\beta,b,\sigma,s)$

- To focus on investment choice and coordination failures, I don't allow this


---
Stage 2: Matching Game
====================================

- A matching is a measure $$x \in M_+ (B^{\emptyset} \times S^{\emptyset})$$

- A matching $x$ is **feasible** for $\mu$ if $x(\emptyset,\emptyset)=0$, and
$$\sum_{s' \in S^{\emptyset}}x(b,s') = \mu(b)~~~\forall b$$
$$\sum_{b' \in B^{\emptyset}}x(b', s) = \mu(s)~~~\forall s$$






  
---
Stage 2: Equilibrium
====================================


<font color=#125972><b>Definition:</b></font> The pair $(x,p)$ is an (ex post) **competitive equilibrium** for $\mu$ if $x$ is feasible for $\mu$,
--

- For each $b \in  \text{ supp } \mu_b$ and each $(b,s^*) \in \text{ supp } x,$
the match maximizes $b$'s utility:

--

$$s^* \in \text{ argmax }_{s \in \text{ supp }  \mu_s }\left\{ v(b,s) - p(b,s)\right\},$$
--

- For each $s \in  \text{ supp } \mu_s$ and each $(b^*,s) \in \text{ supp } x$, the match maximizes $s$'s utility:
--

$$b^* \in \text{ argmax }_{s \in \text{ supp }  \mu_b } \left\{p(b,s)\right\}.$$

???
Walk slowly through each


---
Stage 2: Efficiency
====================================

 

- Social matching gains function given $\mu$
$$g(\mu) \equiv \text{max}_{x} \sum_{b \in B^{\emptyset}} \sum_{s \in S^{\emptyset}} v(b,s) x(b,s)~~~ s.t. x \text{ is feasible given } \mu$$
- An allocation that attains $g(\mu)$ is **conditionally efficient**


---
Stage 2: Efficiency
====================================
- **Conditional First Welfare Theorem**:  If a pair $(x,p)$ is competitive for $\mu$, then it is conditionally efficient

- It is conditional because maximization only holds within the support

- $\text{supp }\mu$ may not include the ex ante efficient $b$ and $s$

- Given the choice in a non-cooperative setting, do people choose the efficient $b$ and $s$?

---
Stage 1: Investments
====================================

- Fix the ex ante population $\mathcal{E}$

- An allocation of investments is a measure $\nu \in M_+(T\times A)$
  - Marginals: $\nu_{T}, \nu_A$
  - $\mu = \nu_{A}$
  
- An allocation $\nu$ is *feasible* for $\mathcal{E}$ if $\nu_T = \mathcal{E}$

- Each agent of type $t$ has price conjectures: $\tilde{p}^t : B^{\emptyset} \times S^{\emptyset} \to \mathbb{R}$

???
$\nu$ is not v$
---
Conjectured Indirect Utility
====================================

- Define conjectured indirect utility of matching

- Buyer with $b$ who conjectures $\tilde{p}^\beta$

$$v^*_b\left(\tilde{p}^\beta\right) = \max_{s \in S^\emptyset}\left\{ v(b,s) - \tilde{p}^\beta(b,s)\right\}$$
- Seller with $s$ who conjectures $\tilde{p}$

$$v^*_s\left(\tilde{p}^\sigma\right) = \max_{b \in B^\emptyset} \left\{\tilde{p}^\sigma(b,s)\right\}$$


---
Investment Equilibrium
====================================

- A tuple $\left(\nu,\left\{ \tilde{p}^t\ \right\}_{t\in T},p,x\right)$ is an **investment equilibrium** for $\mathcal{E}$ if $\nu$ is feasible, $(x,p)$ is a competitive equilibrium for $\nu_A$,

Buyers optimize their investment: for all $(t,b) \in \text{supp } \nu$


$$v_b^*(\tilde{p}^\beta) - c(t,b) \geq v^*_{b'}(\tilde{p}^\beta) - c(t,b') ~~~\forall b' \in B$$


Sellers optimize: for all $(s,t) \in \text{supp } \nu$

$$v_s^*(\tilde{p}^\sigma) - c(s,t) \geq v^*_{s'}(\tilde{p}^\sigma) - c(s',t) ~~~\forall s' \in S$$


Rational conjectures: $$\tilde{p}^t(b,s) = p(b,s) ~~\forall (b,s) \in \text{ supp } \mu_b \times  \text{ supp } \mu_s $$


---
Efficiency
====================================

- Total cost of investments $\nu$ is $\sum_A \sum_T c(t,a) \nu(t,a).$

- Total surplus from $\nu$ is
$$G(\nu) = g(\nu_{A}) - \sum_A \sum_T c(t,a) \nu(t,a).$$

- The allocation $\nu$ is unconditionally **efficient** for $\mathcal{E}$ if it is feasible and $G(\nu) \geq G(\nu')$ for all other feasible allocation $\nu'$


---
Unconstrained conjectures
====================================

- Without more structure, there will often be many equilibria

- Suppose not matching is generates no value generation: $v(\emptyset,s)=v(b,\emptyset)=0$
  - Often assumed in buyer/seller markets
  
- $b=0, s=0$ can be part of an equilibrium through appropriate conjectures
  - No matter how large $v(b,s)$ is, sellers can still rationally conjecture that $p(b,s)=0$

--

- Weakness of Nash equilibrium: 
  - In this class of matching games, the surplus maximizing **and minimizing** outcomes can occur


---
Need for Refinement
====================================

- Off-path conjectures are a free parameter

- Why would sellers conjecture $\tilde{p}^t(1,1) = 0$?

--

- Economists have recognized this issue in other competitive contexts:

  - Zame (2007) - "imposing no discipline would admit equilibria which are **viable only because different agents hold contradictory conjectures**"

--

  - Gale (1992) - "Typically, there exists a large number of equilibria and **some refinement of the equilibrium concept is required to give the theory predictive power**. One such refinement is based on the notion of the 'trembling' hand."


---
Perturbations
====================================

- Consider a perturbed strategy vector for all buyers, $\epsilon_B = (\epsilon(b))_{b \in B},$ satisfying  $\epsilon(b)>0$ for all $b \in B$ and 
$$\sum_B \epsilon(b) \leq 1$$
- For all sellers $\epsilon_S = (\epsilon(s))_{s \in S},$ satisfying  $\epsilon(s)>0$ for all $s \in S$ and 
$$\sum_S \epsilon(s) \leq 1$$

- A perturbed game is indexed by the vector of perturbed strategies $\epsilon = (\epsilon_B,\epsilon_S)$

---
$\epsilon$-Investment Equilibria
====================================

- An allocation $\nu(\epsilon)$ is $\epsilon$-feasible for $\mathcal{E}$ if  $\nu_T = \mathcal{E}$ and for all $a \in A$
$$\nu_{A}(\epsilon(a)) \geq \epsilon(a)$$

- A tuple $\left(\nu(\epsilon), \left\{ \tilde{p}^t\ \right\}_{t\in T},p,x\right)$ is an $\epsilon$-investment equilibrium for $\mathcal{E}$ if $\nu$ is $\epsilon$-feasible, $p$ is a competitive price for $\nu_A$, and for all $(t,a)$ such that $\nu_{A}(\epsilon) > \epsilon$,

$$v_a^*(\tilde{p}^t) - c(t,a) \geq v^*_{a'}(\tilde{p}^t) - c(a',t) ~~~\forall a' \in A$$

--

- Note that by construction, $\text{ supp } \nu_{A}(\epsilon) = A$

--

- A tuple  $\left(\nu,\left\{ \tilde{p}^t\ \right\}_{t\in T},p,x\right)$ is a **perfect investment equilibria** if there exists a sequence of $\epsilon$, such that $\lim_{k \to \infty} M(\epsilon^k)=0$ such that $\left(\nu(\epsilon),\left\{ \tilde{p}^t\ \right\}_{t\in T},p,x\right) \to \left(\nu,\left\{ \tilde{p}^t\ \right\}_{t\in T},p,x\right)$.

---
Restricted Efficiency
====================================
- The allocation $\nu(\epsilon)$ is $\epsilon$-efficient for $\mathcal{E}$ if it is feasible and $G(\nu(\epsilon)) \geq G(\nu'(\epsilon))$ for all other $\epsilon$-feasible allocation $\nu'$

- **Lemma 1**: If $(\nu(\epsilon), p)$ is an $\epsilon$-investment equilibrium, then it is $\epsilon$-efficient.

--

- Proof: 

 Let $Q(\epsilon)$ be the utility generated by the trembling actions

 $$Q(\epsilon)=  \sum_b \left\{\sum_\beta  \left[v^*_b\left(\tilde{p}^\beta\right) - c(\beta,b)\right]\nu_T(\beta)\right\}\epsilon(b)$$
 
$$+ \sum_s \left\{\sum_\sigma  \left[v^*_s\left(\tilde{p}^\sigma\right) - c(\sigma,s)\right]\nu_T(\sigma)\right\}\epsilon(s).$$


---
Proof (continued)
====================================

- Hence, 

$$\sum_\beta \left[ \max_{b,s}  v(b,s) - \tilde{p}^\beta (b,s)- c\left(\beta, b\right)\right] \nu_T(\beta)\left( 1 - \epsilon(b)\right)$$  

$$+  \sum_\sigma \left[\max_{b,s}  \tilde{p}^\sigma (b,s)  - c\left(\sigma, s\right)\right]\nu_T(\sigma)\left( 1 - \epsilon(s)\right)$$

<!--$$\underbrace{\left(  \left[\max_b v(b,s) - \tilde{p}^\beta (b,s) - c\left(\beta, b\right)\right] + \left[\max_s  \tilde{p}^\sigma (b,s)  - c\left(\sigma, s\right)\right] \right) \left(1 - \sum_a \epsilon(a) \right)}_{\text{Optimized Choice}}$$-->
$$ + \underbrace{Q(\epsilon)}_{\text{Constrained Choice}}$$

- But since all actions are played by trembles, $\tilde{p}^\beta(b,s) =\tilde{p}^\sigma(b,s)$ 

- Therefore they optimize the entire left expression

- It is exactly the complete market problem, which is efficient $\qquad \blacksquare$

Full Efficiency
====================================

- **Theorem**: If  $\left(\nu,\left\{ \tilde{p}^t\ \right\}_{t\in T},p,x\right)$ is a perfect investment equilibrium, then it is efficient.

--

- Proof: 

 Immediate from Lemma 1, since  $\underbrace{Q(\epsilon)}_{\text{Constrained Choice}} \to 0$ $\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \blacksquare$

Common Conjectures Justifications
====================================

- Predictive power comes from imposing more restrictions on conjectures than just rational conjectures

- Trembling hand + large market $\Rightarrow$ as-if complete markets

- Complete markets means rational conjectures $\Rightarrow$ common conjectures 

--

- Other approaches:
  - Dubey and Geanakoplos (2002): fictitious seller who contributes an infinitesimal to each health insurance pool
  
  - Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik (2005): government intervenes to sell infinitesimal quantities of each asset and fully delivers on its promises
  
  - Zame (2007): only considers "common-conjecture" equilibria

Policy Relevance
====================================

- "Big push"

---
Conclusion
====================================

- Under competition, coordination failures rely contradictory conjectures

- If people can disagree, then of course there are many equilibria

- If we want predictive power, we must use a refinement

- I use trembling-hand perfection


Main theorem: Modified First Welfare Theorem
