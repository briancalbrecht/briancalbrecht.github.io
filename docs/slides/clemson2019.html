Two Views of Politics
====================================

First, government failure theory:

  - Political decision makers have power and can extract from citizens 
  
  - Politics involves concentrated benefits and dispered costs (Olson 1965)
  
  - Politics as social conflict (Acemoglu 2003)
  
--

  - Boettke, Coyne, and Leeson (2007):
      
.center[when we examine policy reality in light of that economic]
.center[theory we see **inefficient policies** all the time]

---
Two Conflicting Views of Politics
====================================

Second, Chicago school of political economy

  - Politics essentially reflects the preferences of voters
  
  - Politics reflects supply and demand for legislation (Becker 1983)
  
  - Politics as exchange (Buchanan 1987)
  
  - Political "Coase" theorem leads to efficiency

--
  
  - Stigler (1992):
  
.center[every durable social institution or practice]
.center[**is efficient**, or it would not persist over time]

---
Move to Evolutionary Perspective
====================================

- For efficiency, institutions must **select** for efficient policies

--

- Alchian (1950): profit mechanism selects for firms who have made relatively
better choices concerning profit-making

--

- **Goal**: develop a model of politics as dynamic, evolutionary process

--

- Interest group formation in democracies as selection mechanism: 
  - Interest groups pay cost to form,
  
  - Enter politics, and 
  
  - Overturn policies

--

- Politics moves from conflict to cooperation as selection improves

---
Roadmap for Talk
====================================

1. Simple Coasean Example

  a. Static Bargaining
  
  b. Dynamic Bargaining

2. Formal Real Option Model 

3. Model Results

  a. Formal Propositions
  
  b. Broader Implications

---
Static Political "Coase" Theorem
====================================

- Suppose competiting interest groups bargain over policy
  - e.g. steel producers vs. steel consumers

- Steel producers wants to enact tariffs with benefit `\(B\)` to them

- Consumers would incur a cost `\(C\)`

- Without organization costs, new policy is enacted if `\(B &gt; C\)`

---
Static Political "Coase" Theorem
====================================

- In standard model, tariffs are inefficient since `\(B &lt; C\)`

- Consumers can organize into interest group and block tariff

- Consumers can offer to pay producers an amount `\(B + \epsilon &lt; C\)`

- Without transaction costs, no tariff policy is efficient

- Yet we see many tariffs: why?

---
Adding Organizational Costs
====================================


- Cost of organizing group `\(i \in \{P, C\}:~~O_i\)`

- Organize and enact policy if `\(B - O_P &gt; 0\)`

- If `\(B&lt;C\)`, to prevent this policy, consumers must form and pay a bribe, costing them:  `\(B - O_P + \epsilon + O_C\)`

- If `\(B &lt; C\)`, but `\(B + \epsilon + (O_C - O_P) &gt; C\)`, then bribe will never materialize

- Rest of society is better off living with `\(C\)` than working to prevent

- `\(O_C - O_P\)` creates wedge preventing efficient policies
  - Olson (1965)



---
Moving to Dynamics
====================================

- Previous examples can't speak to dynamic persistence vs. transitory policies

- As if a one time, eternal vote on policy

- A policy passed last week is just as likely to be inefficient as long, lasting and wide spread policies

- We address the difference with a dynamic model


---
Dynamic Model
====================================

- `\(B\)` flow benefit to producers `\(\Rightarrow\)`  `\(B/r\)` present value
  - `\(r=\)` real interest rate
  

- To overturn policy, consumers would have to enter the political market and pay the producers `\(B/r + \epsilon\)`


- If steel productivity in foreign countries follows a random walk, then `\(C\)` will follow a random walk


- Once `\(C\)` crosses some threshold consumers will enter

- Threshold depends on `\(O_C\)` and the time-series properties of `\(C\)`

---
Theoretical Results
====================================

- ### Proposition 1: 
  - Policy inefficiencies are eliminated in the long run

--

- ### Proposition 2: 
  - The level of inefficiency is bounded in the short run

--

- ### Proposition 3:
  - Static analysis finds too many inefficient politics


---
Building On
====================================
  
- Interest group models of politics

  - Stigler (1971), Peltzman (1976), Posner (1974), Becker (1983), Tollison (1988)
  
  - Focus on dynamic **selection mechanisms**
  
--

- Evolutionary perspective of institutions

  - Markets: Alchian (1950), Smith (2007), Todd and Gigerenzer (2012)
  
  - Common law: Rubin (1977), Priest (1977), Gennaioli and Shleifer (2007)
  
  - Focus on **legislative institutions**


---
A Formal Model
====================================

- Standard real option model

- Time is continuous, lasts forever

- Current policy generates: 
  - Flow benefits to current interest group: `\(B\)`
  - Flow cost to rest of society: `\(C\)`

- Cost to organize an interest group: `\(O\)`


---
class:middle
`$$\textrm{Entry benefit} = \underbrace{E \int_t^{\infty} e^{-\rho t} C(t)dt}_{\textrm{Expected Cost Saving}} - \underbrace{\bigg(E \int_t^{\infty} e^{-\rho t} B(t)dt + \epsilon\bigg)}_\textrm{Expected Bribe} - \underbrace{O}_{\textrm{Entry Cost}}$$`
- Alternatively,

`$$\textrm{Entry benefit} = \underbrace{E \int_t^{\infty} e^{-\rho t}[C(t) - B(t)]dt - \epsilon}_{\textrm{Expected Net Cost Saving}} - \underbrace{O}_{\textrm{Entry Cost}}$$`

- `\(N = C - B\)`: net social cost of the current policy

- If `\(N&gt;0\)`, policy is **inefficient**


---
Brownian Motion
====================================

- Net social cost of the policy varies randomly and exogenously
  - Outside control of any interest group

- Geometric Brownian motion
`$$\frac{dN(t)}{N(t)} = \mu dt + \sigma dz$$`
  - `\(\mu \geq 0\)`: expected rate of change in the net cost
  - `\(\sigma\)`: conditional standard deviation
  - `\(dz\)`: increment of a Wiener process
    - `\(dz = \epsilon \sqrt{dt}\)`, where `\(\epsilon\)` is drawn from a standard normal distribution 
    
---
Real Option to Enter
====================================


- The interest group always has the option to enter the political market and end the costly policy

- Option to enter is like a financial option

- Can derive the value of this option as a function of the net cost of existing legislation

- Can determine the precise value for the net cost at which the prospective interest group will decide to enter the market

---
name:option_value
Option Value
====================================

- Let `\(V(N)\)` be the option value to enter the political market

- Recursive representation:
`$$V(N, t) = \frac{1}{1 + \rho \Delta t} E V(N', t + \Delta t)$$`
  - `\(\rho\)`: rate of time preference
  - `\(E\)`: expectations operator
  - `\(N'\)`: net cost of the policy after a time interval of length `\(\Delta t\)`

- [In continuous time](#continuous_time) `$$\rho V(N) = \frac{1}{dt} E dV$$`

---
name:diffeq_solution
Solution
====================================

- `\(\rho V(N) = 1/dt E dV\)` has [known solution](#diffeq_solving)
`$$V(N) = \alpha_1 N^{\beta^+} + \alpha_2 N^{\beta^-}$$`
- Simplify using economic intuition

- First, option becomes worthless when net cost goes to zero

`$$\lim_{N \rightarrow 0} V(N) = 0$$`
- Only holds if `\(\alpha_2=0\)`

`$$V(N) = \alpha_1 N^{\beta^+}$$`

---
class:middle

- Second, let `\(N^*\)` be the net cost when the interest group enters

- At `\(N^*\)` the interest group must be indifferent between holding and exercising option

`$$V(N^*) = \alpha_1 (N^*)^{\beta^+} = \frac{N^*}{\rho - \mu} - O$$`

- We assume that `\(\epsilon \approx 0\)`

- Solving this expression for `\(\alpha_1\)` yields:
`$$\alpha_1 = (N^*)^{-\beta^+}  \bigg(\frac{N^*}{\rho - \mu} - O\bigg)$$`

---
Full Solution
====================================
`$$V(N) = \underbrace{\bigg(\frac{N}{N^*}\bigg)^{\beta^+}}_{\textrm{Stochastic Discount Factor}} \times \underbrace{\bigg(\frac{N^*}{\rho - \mu} - O\bigg)}_{\textrm{Value at the Exercise Point}}$$`
--

- High `\(N^*\)` raises yields greater benefit when option is exercised
  - Do not pay `\(O\)` on low `\(N\)` policies
  
- However, high `\(N^*\)` means longer wait times on policies

--

- The optimal `\(N^*\)` trades these off to maximize option value

`$$N^* = \bigg(\frac{\beta}{\beta - 1}\bigg) (\rho - \mu) O$$`

---
Stochastic Time
====================================

- `\(N^*\)` is proportional to organizational cost, `\(O\)`

- If `\(N \geq N^*\)`, the interest group will enter the political market and bribe the existing interest group to overturn the inefficient policy

- `\(N\)` is stochastic, the amount of time that an inefficient policy will last is also stochastic

- Let `\(\tilde{T}\)` denote the time period when the interest group enters,
`$$\tilde{T} = \inf \{t \geq 0 | N \geq N^* \}$$`


---
Selection Mechanism
====================================

- Consider a particular policy `\(j\)`

- Prospective interest groups will enter whenever `\(N_j \geq N^*_j\)`

- Interest group entry is a **selection mechanism** that eliminates inefficient policies

- Inefficient policies will tend to be eliminated faster as `\(N^*_j\)` declines, such as when `\(O\)` declines

---
Asymptotic Efficiency
====================================

### Proposition 1: The probability that any inefficient policy `\(j\)` survives goes to zero as time goes to infinity.
--
Idea: 

- Equivalent to stating that the stopping time is finite, or `\(P(\tilde{T} &lt; \infty) = 1\)`. 

- Known result for Brownian motion with a constant barrier
  - See Stokey (2009, Theorem 5.1)

---
class: middle, center

##"Every durable social institution or practice is efficient, &lt;br&gt; or it would not persist over time."

.right[George Stigler (1992)]


---
Bounded Inefficiency
====================================

### Proposition 2: For any parameters `\(\rho, \mu_j, \sigma_j\)` there is an upper bound on the level of inefficiency.
--

- Similar result to static model

Proof: 

If a policy is still in place at time `\(t\)`, this implies that the net cost to society `\(N_j(t)\)` is below `\(N_j^*\)`. 

`$$\frac{N_j(t)}{\rho - \mu_j} \leq %\frac{N_j^*}{\rho - \mu_j} = 
\bigg(\frac{\beta_j}{\beta_j - 1}\bigg) O_j.$$`

This provides the upper bound on the level of inefficiency.



---
Implication for Political Economy
====================================


- Political economists who want to argue that a particular long-lasting policy is inefficient must

  1. Reconsider the magnitude of the cost of the policy, or
  
  2. Explain why the organizational costs are so high
  
- Otherwise, political economists can claim there are $10 trillion bills on the sidewalk

---
Comparative Inefficiency
====================================

### Corollary: The bound on the inefficiencies is increasing in the organizational costs, `\(O_j\)`.

- Implication: societies with lower organizational costs will have more efficient policies

- More later on this


---
Dynamic vs. Static 
====================================
### Proposition 3: There exist policies that are dynamically efficient that are statically inefficient.

- Proof: In a static environment, interest groups have not entered if 
`$$E\int_0^{\infty} e^{-\rho t} [C_j(t) - B_j(t)] dt =  E\int_0^{\infty} e^{-\rho t} N_j(t) dt = \frac{N_j}{\rho - \mu_j} \leq O_j$$`

In the dynamic model, it is
`$$\frac{N_j(t)}{\rho - \mu_j} \leq \frac{\beta_j}{\beta_j - 1}O_j$$`

---
The Role of Uncertainty
====================================

- People prefer to wait and see if the net costs are moderate before paying the organizational costs

- If costs remain moderate, people will be willing to tolerate them

- Political economists who do not consider the politics as a process will **over-diagnose inefficiencies**


---
Model Implications
====================================

1. Losers must be compensated 

2. Durable legislation helps efficiency

3. Lowering political organization costs improves efficiency



---
Just Compensation (Cutsinger 2018)
====================================

- In 2010, the House of Representatives changed significantly

- They eliminated a housing counseling assistance program 

- Program had given $88 million to non-profit organization

- Justice Department's settlement authority restored half of funding

- $30 million came from large banks based on their conduct in the mortgage backed securities market


---
Durability of Legislation
====================================

- Settlement authority makes policy effectively **more durable**: even if overturned, but be paid value of rents

- Raises `\(E\int_0^{\infty} e^{-\rho t} C_j(t) dt\)` and encourages entry


- If efficiency improving legislation is likely to be overturned later legislatures, willingness to pay `\(O_j\)` drops

- Similar result to principal-agent models of politicians: future benefits encourage efficient action today

- `\(\Rightarrow\)` Institutions that enhance durability improve efficiency


---
Independent Judiciary 
====================================


- Durability has value, then legislatures will have an incentive to make it difficult to overturn legislation 

- Landes and Posner (1975): independent judiciary can favor original interpretations and need not be subservient to current legislatures

- Anderson, Shughart, and Tollison (1989): legislatures reward judges who display independence with higher salaries

- Implication: judicial independence could explain variation in interest group
formation and the efficiency of policy


---
Free Speech
====================================

- Our most direct implication: lower `\(O_j\)` improves efficiency

- U.S. Supreme Court upheld freedom of speech for corporations, unions, and non-profits
making explicit reference to interest groups

- Justice Kennedy argued in favor of the **informational role** of interest groups, not just constitutional rights

- Speech restrictions increase the organizational costs

- If our theory is correct, the ruling is efficiency enhancing


---
Re-framing Political Economy
====================================

Normative Implications:

- Proposition 1 and 2 lead to a *pre*sumption of efficiency 
  (Breton 1993)
  
- However, policies are efficient by assumption
  - Avoid whatever is, is efficient

- Long last policies likely have a hidden efficiency justification (Hendrickson, Salter, and Albrecht 2018)

--

Positive Implications:

- Role of political economist is to identify the relevant organizational costs

- Mirrors Steven Cheung's (1998) approach to study of markets:

.center["whenever the Pareto condition fails to hold we would]
.center[immediately know that some constraints are missing."]

Continuous Time
====================================

`$$V(N, t) = \frac{1}{1 + \rho \Delta t} E V(N', t + \Delta t)$$`

- Multiplying both side of  by `\(1 + \rho \Delta t\)` and re-arranging yields `$$\rho V(N) = \frac{1}{\Delta t} E dV$$` where `\(EdV := E V(N', t + \Delta t) - V(N, t)\)`.

- Taking the limit as `\(\Delta t\)` goes to zero.
`$$\rho V(N) = \frac{1}{dt} E dV$$`
- [Return](#option_value)

name:diffeq_solving

Solving Differential Equation
====================================

Using Ito's Lemma option formula can be written as
`$$\rho V(N) = \frac{1}{dt} E\bigg[ V'(N) dN + \frac{1}{2} V''(N) (dN)^2\bigg]$$`
Substituting and simplifying yields:
`$$\frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 N^2 V''(N) + \mu N V'(N) - \rho V(N) = 0$$`
Second-order differential equation has a known solution of the form:
`$$V(N) = \alpha_1 N^{\beta^+} + \alpha_2 N^{\beta^-}$$`

---
Solving Differential Equation
====================================

`$$V(N) = \alpha_1 N^{\beta^+} + \alpha_2 N^{\beta^-}$$`

where `\(\alpha_1\)` and `\(\alpha_2\)` are positive constants and `\(\beta^+\)` and `\(\beta^-\)` are the positive and negative solutions, respectively, to the quadratic equation:
`$$\frac{1}{2} \beta^2 + \bigg(\mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2\bigg) \beta - \rho = 0$$`
