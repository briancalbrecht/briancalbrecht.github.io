Competitive Coordination
====================================

- Important investments are sunk before entering a market

  - Invest in education before being hired
  - Produce goods before having a buyer
  - Write JMP before knowing schools want a general equilibrium theorist
  
--

- When investments are sunk, i.e. when markets are incomplete, coordination failures can arise even with **competitive markets**
  - Makowski &amp; Ostroy (1995), Cole, Malaith, &amp; Postlewaite (1999a, 1999b), Makowski (2004), N&amp;ouml;ldeke &amp; Samuelson (2014), Felli &amp; Roberts (2016)

--
  
- Previous literature only studies **existence** of coordination failures

---
My Question
====================================
--

- Are the investments we see out in the world likely to be inefficient? 

--

- Are coordination failures **robust**?

--

- Should we predict coordination failures?

--


## My Answer

- **No**, if markets are Walrasian

--

- Formally, inefficient equilibria are not robust to a trembling-hand refinement

--

- We should predict an efficient outcome

---
Sketch of Environment
====================================

- Continuum of buyers and sellers, finite types

- Transferable utility (for now)

---
Results so far
=====================

- **Main Theorem**: With a continuum of players, every perfect equilibria is efficient

- Proposition: In the appropriate limit of any sequence of finite games, every perfect equilibria is efficient


---
Simple General Mechanism
====================================

- Coordination failures arise because markets are incomplete
  - Emphasis of literature

- **And** people must hold conflicting, pessimistic conjectures about prices
  - Buyers think price will be high
  - Sellers think price will be low

--

- Possibility of "mistakes" constrains equilibrium conjectures

&lt;!--  - With a trembling-hand, all strategies are played --&gt;

- Refined beliefs are constrained to be as-if markets were complete

- As-if complete markets gives efficiency

  - Ex Post Efficiency

3. Investment Game where Players Choose Attributes

  - Investment Equilibria
  - Perfect Investment Equilibria
  - Ex Ante Efficiency

---
Example
====================================

- Buyers pick `\(b \in B\)`, sellers pick `\(s \in S\)`

- Suppose `\(B = S = [0,1]\)`, continuum of buyers and sellers

- Cost to buyer = `\(\frac{1}{4}b\)`;  Cost to seller = `\(\frac{1}{4}s\)`

- Surplus `\(v(s) = bs\)` is split through transfer to seller `\(p(s)\)`

  - Price is only a function of `\(s\)` because the seller does not care which `\(b\)` pays her `\(p(s)\)`

---
Investment Equilibrium
====================================

1. Prices clear the matching market

1. Each buyer `\(i\)` chooses `\(b\)` to maximize utility, given price conjectures: `\(\tilde{p}^i(s)\)`

2. Each seller `\(j\)` chooses `\(s\)` to maximize utility, given price conjectures: `\(\tilde{p}^j(s)\)`

3. Rational conjectures: conjectures are not contradicted by the data
  - If `\(s\)` exists in the economy, `\(\tilde{p}^i (s) = \tilde{p}^j (s)= p(s)\)`
  - If `\(s\)` does not, conjectures are not pinned down 

--

- Equilibrium does not require optimization "off-path" (like Nash)
  
  
---
Giving the Theory Predictive Power
====================================

- Off-path conjectures are a free parameter

- With no other restrictions, there is a continuum of investment equilibria:
  - Efficient: `\(b=s=1\)`
  - Worst: `\(b=s=0\)`

- **Zero predictive power** from the equilibrium concept used by all of the literature*

Perfection
====================================

- For predictive power, conjectures must be disciplined even off-path

- Selten (1975): rational behavior is a limiting case of irrational behavior

- "Trembles" are perturbations or mistakes to explain off-path moves

- Note that for general games, trembling hand perfect equilibria [can be inefficient](#thp_proof)



---
Perturbed Strategies
====================================

- Trembling hand: each attribute must be chosen with positive probability density `\(\epsilon(b)&gt;0, \epsilon(s)&gt;0\)` by each buyer and seller

- Assume in the aggregate each attribute must be chosen by a positive density of players
  
- Perfect equilibrium: limit of a sequence of `\(\epsilon \to 0\)`

- Claim: The unique perfect equilibrium allocation is efficient

  
---

- With trembling hand, each `\(b\)`b and `\(s\)` are played `\(\Rightarrow\)` `\(\tilde{p}^i(s) = \tilde{p}^j(s) = p(s)\)`

- If `\(p(1) &gt; \frac{1}{4}\)`, sellers want to choose `\(s=1\)` as much as possible: `\(1 - \epsilon\)`

- If `\(p(1) &lt; \frac{3}{4}\)`, buyers want to choose `\(b=1\)` as much as possible: `\(1 - \epsilon\)`

--

- Therefore, for any perturbation, equilibrium requires
`$$p(1) \in \left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]$$`


- As perturbations go to zero, `\((1,1)\)` is the unique equilibrium strategy profile
  - Prices are not necessarily unique


--

- **Main Theorem**: for a general class of assignment models with investments, all *perfect* investment equilibria are efficient

---
Stage 1: Types
====================================
- Following Makowski (2004)

- Buyer names: `\(i \in I\)` `\(~~~~\)` Seller names: `\(j \in J\)`

- Finite Types: `\(\beta : I \to \mathcal{B}\)` `\(~~~~\)`  `\(\sigma : J \to \mathcal{S}\)`

- Possible types: `\(t \in T = \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{S}\)`

- Economy: a positive measure on `\(T\)`: `$$E \in M_+(T)$$`



---
Stage 1: Attributes
====================================
- Each individual must acquire/invest in one attribute  `\(A\)`

- `\(A\)` is partitioned into attributes that are feasible for buyers `\(B\)` and feasible for sellers `\(S\)`

- Type determines cost of acquiring attribute `$$c : A \times T \to \mathbb{R} \cup {\infty}$$`

- `\(c(a,t)\)` is the cost of acquiring `\(a\)` for type `\(t\)`

--

- Individual choices lead to distribution of attributes `\(\mu \in M_+(A)\)`

- For any Borel subset `\(E \subset A\)`, `\(\mu(E)\)` is the mass of individuals with attributes in `\(E\)`

---
.center[![](https://briancalbrecht.github.io/docs/slides/images/jmp/tikz_C.png)]

--

- I assume "naive" competition in the continuum through price-taking
  - Everyone acts like price-takers, even when they do not face perfectly elastic demand and supply curves

- Ultimately, I don't want to assume price-taking but prove as in Gretsky, Ostroy, &amp; Zame (1999) or Makowski (2004)


---
Stage 2: Assignment Game
====================================

- Prices of sellers coordinate the assignment: `\(p : B^0 \times S^0 \to \mathbb{R}\)` 

- To allow individuals to remain unmatched, let `\(B^0 \equiv B \cup {0}\)` and `\(S^0 \equiv S \cup {0}\)`

- An assignment is a measure `$$x \in M_+ (B^0 \times S^0)$$`

- An assignment `\(x\)` is **feasible** for `\(\mu\)` if `\(x(0,0)=0\)`, and for all Borel subsets, `\(E \subset B\)` and `\(F \subset S\)`,
`$$x(E, S^0) = \mu(E)$$`
`$$x(B^0, F) = \mu(F)$$`



---
Value Functions
====================================
- Bounded continuous value function: `\(v : B^0 \times S^0 \to \mathbb{R}\)`
  - In general, no further assumptions
  - When `\(v\)` is supermodular, coordination problems are possible*


- Social assignment gains function given `\(\mu\)`
`$$g(\mu) \equiv \text{sup} \int v dx~~~ s.t. x \text{ is feasible given } \mu$$`
- An allocation that attains `\(g(\mu)\)` is **conditionally efficient**

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/font&gt;


  
---
Stage 2: Equilibrium
====================================


&lt;font color=#125972&gt;&lt;b&gt;Definition:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The pair `\((x,p)\)` is an (ex post) **Walrasian equilibrium** for `\(\mu\)` if `\(x\)` is feasible for `\(\mu\)`, `\(p(0) \equiv 0\)`,
--

- For each `\(b \in  \text{supp } \mu\)` and each `\((b,s) \in \text{supp } x,\)`

`$$v(s) - p(s)= v_b^*(p) \equiv \max_{s' \in S^0} v(b,s') - p(b,s')$$`
--

- For each `\(s \in  \text{supp } \mu\)` and each `\((b,s) \in \text{supp } x,\)`, `\(b \in B\)` implies 

`$$p(s) = v_s^*(p) \equiv \max \left\{p(s), v(0,s)\right\},$$`

---
Stage 2: Efficiency
====================================
- **Conditional First Welfare Theorem**:  If a pair `\((x,p)\)` is Walrasian for `\(\mu\)`, then it is conditionally efficient

- Conditional because maximization only occurs within the support of `\(\mu\)`

- `\(\mu\)` may be missing the efficient `\(b\)` and `\(s\)`

- Given the choice in a non-cooperative setting, do people choose the efficient `\(b\)` and `\(s\)`?

  - Walrasian Equilibria with Fixed Investments
  - Conditional Efficiency

3. **Investment Game where Players Choose Atrributes**

  - Investment Equilibria
  - Perfect Investment Equilibria
  - Efficiency

---
Stage 1: Attributes
====================================

- Fix the ex ante population `\(E\)`

- An allocation of attributes is a measure `\(\nu \in M_+(A\times T)\)`
  - Marginals: `\(\nu_{A}, \nu_T\)`
  - `\(\mu = \nu_{A}\)`
  
- An allocation `\(\nu\)` is *feasible* for `\(E\)` if `\(\nu_T = E\)`


---
Equilibrium
====================================

- A pair `\((\nu, p)\)` is an **investment equilibrium** for `\(E\)` if `\(\nu\)` is feasible, `\(p\)` is a Walrasian price for `\(\mu\)`, and for all `\((a,t) \in \text{supp } \nu\)`

`$$v_a^*(p) - c(a,t) \geq v^*_{a'}(p) - c(a',t) ~~~\forall a' \in A$$`

- Optimization is only required over attributes in $ \text{supp } \nu$

---
Efficiency
====================================

- Total cost of attributes `\(\nu\)` is `\(\int c d\nu\)`

- Total surplus from `\(\nu\)` is
`$$G(\nu) = g(\nu_{A}) - \int c d\nu$$`

- The allocation `\(\nu\)` is **efficient** for `\(E\)` if it is feasible and `\(G(\nu) \geq G(\nu')\)` for all other feasible allocation `\(\nu'\)`

---
Return to Example
====================================

- Investment equilibria need not be fully efficient

- Consider again the continuum example `\(B=S=[0,1]\)`

- Surplus: `\(v(s) = b s\)`

- For all buyers, `\(b=0\)`, for all sellers `\(s=0\)`, and `\(p(s)=0\)` is an investment equilibrium

- No profitable deviation
`$$\underbrace{0}_{\text{Surplus}} - \underbrace{0}_{\text{Transfer}} - \underbrace{0}_{\text{Cost of }b=0} \geq \underbrace{0}_{\text{Surplus}} - \underbrace{0}_{\text{Transfer}} - \underbrace{\frac{1}{4}b}_{\text{Cost of }b&gt;0}$$`

---
Unconstrained Beliefs
====================================

- Without more structure, there will often be many equilibria

- Because off-path beliefs are a free parameter

- But why would sellers conjecture `\(p(1) = 0\)`?

--

- Economists have recognized this issue in other Walrasian contexts:

  - Zame (2007) - "imposing no discipline would admit equilibria which are **viable only because different agents hold contradictory beliefs**"

--

  - Gale (1992) - "Typically, there exists a large number of equilibria and **some refinement of the equilibrium concept is required to give the theory predictive power**. One such refinement is based on the notion of the 'trembling' hand."


---
Perturbations
====================================

- Consider a perturbed strategy vector for all buyers `\(i \in I\)`, `\(\epsilon_B = (\epsilon(b))_{b \in B},\)` satisfying  `\(\epsilon(b)&gt;0\)` for all `\(b \in B\)` and 
`$$\int_B \epsilon(b)db \leq 1$$`
- For all sellers `\(\epsilon_S = (\epsilon(s))_{s \in S},\)` satisfying  `\(\epsilon(s)&gt;0\)` for all `\(s \in S\)` and 
`$$\int_S \epsilon(s)ds \leq 1$$`

- A perturbed games is index by the set of perturbed strategy vectors `\(\epsilon = (\epsilon_B,\epsilon_S)\)`

---
`\(\epsilon\)`-Investment Equilibria
====================================

- An allocation `\(\nu(\epsilon)\)` is `\(\epsilon\)`-feasible for `\(E\)` if  `\(\nu_T = E\)` and for all `\(a \in A\)`
`$$\nu_{A}(\epsilon) \geq \epsilon(a)$$`

- A pair `\((\nu(\epsilon), p)\)` is an `\(\epsilon\)`-investment equilibrium for `\(E\)` if `\(\nu\)` is `\(\epsilon\)`-feasible, `\(p\)` is a Walrasian price for `\(\mu\)`, and for all `\((a,t)\)` such that `\(\nu_{A}(\epsilon) &gt; \epsilon\)`,

`$$v_a^*(p) - c(a,t) \geq v^*_{a'}(p) - c(a',t) ~~~\forall a' \in A$$`

--

- Note that by construction, `\(\text{ supp } \nu_{A}(\epsilon) = A\)`

--

- A pair `\((\nu,p)\)` is a **perfect investment equilibria** if there exists a sequence of `\(\epsilon\)`, such that `\(\lim_{k \to \infty} M(\epsilon^k)=0\)` such that `\((\nu(\epsilon^k),p) \to (\nu,p)\)`.

---
Restricted Efficiency
====================================
- The allocation `\(\nu(\epsilon)\)` is `\(\epsilon\)`-efficient for `\(E\)` if it is feasible and `\(G(\nu(\epsilon)) \geq G(\nu'(\epsilon))\)` for all other `\(\epsilon\)`-feasible allocation `\(\nu'\)`

- **Lemma 1**: If `\((\nu(\epsilon), p)\)` is an `\(\epsilon\)`-investment equilibrium, then it is `\(\epsilon\)`-efficient.

--

- Proof: 

 Let `\(Q(\epsilon)\)` be the utility generate by the trembling actions
`$$Q(\epsilon)= \int \int \left[v^*_a(p) - c(a,t)\right]\epsilon(a)da~ d \nu_t$$`


---
Proof (continued)
====================================

- Hence, 

`$$\underbrace{\left(\int  \left[\max_b v(s) - \tilde{p}^i (s) - c(b,i)\right] di  + \int\left[\max_s  \tilde{p}^j (s)  - c(s,j)\right] dj\right) \left(1 - \int \epsilon(a) da \right)}_{\text{Optimized Choice}}$$`
$$ + \underbrace{Q(\epsilon)}_{\text{Constrained Choice}}$$

- But since all actions are played by trembles, `\(\tilde{p}^i(s) =\tilde{p}^j(s)\)` 

- Therefore they optimize the entire left expression

- It is looks exactly like a static problem, which we know is efficient `\(\qquad \blacksquare\)`


---
Full Efficiency
====================================

- **Theorem 1**: If `\((\nu, p)\)` is a perfect investment equilibrium, then it is efficient.

--

- Proof: 

 Immediate from Lemma 1, since  `\(\underbrace{Q(\epsilon)}_{\text{Constrained Choice}} \to 0\)` `\(\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \blacksquare\)`

---
Other Justifications
====================================

- Predictive power comes from imposing more restrictions on beliefs than just rational expectations

- Trembling hand + continuum `\(\Rightarrow\)` as-if complete markets

--

- Other approaches:
  - Dubey and Geanakoplos (2002): fictitious seller who contributes an infinitesimal to each health insurance pool
  
  - Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik (2006): government intervenes to sell infinitesimal quantities of each asset and fully delivers on its promises
  
  - Zame (2007): on considers "common-belief" equilibria

---
Finite Buyers and Sellers
====================================

- Above approaches would directly extend Theorem 1 to finite players

- In general, my trembling hand does not offer a refinement with finite players

- But it does offer a refinement for a specific limit

---
Asymptotic Results
====================================

- Trembling hand perfection already involves a limit: `\(\epsilon \to 0\)`

- Generally, asymptotics about the economy involve the size of the economy getting larger: `\(|I| + |J| \to \infty\)`
  - In particular, we can consider any replica economy, indexed by `\(N\)`

- Predictive power remains if we consider
  `$$\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \lim_{N \to \infty} \quad \text{IE}_{\epsilon}(E(N))\Rightarrow \text{No coordination failures}$$`
- But not the other order

`$$\lim_{N \to \infty} \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \quad \text{IE}_{\epsilon}(E(N))\Rightarrow \text{Coordination failures possible}$$`

---
Conclusion
====================================

- With price-taking, coordination failures rely on using beliefs as a free parameter and constructing overly pessimistic conjectures

- If we want predictive power, we must use a refinement

- Trembling hand perfection is one option

- In an Walrasian assignment model with investment, every perfect equilibrium is efficient

- Mathematical mechanism: trembles generate complete markets

- Even though in equilibrium, markets are endogenous and incomplete


---
Next Steps
====================================

- Extend to imperfectly transferable utility case

  - Especially relevant for competitive matching models
  - N&amp;ouml;ldeke &amp; Samuelson (2014, 2018) provide framework


- Extend to moral hazard as in Zame (2007) and Rahman (2012)

- Move from Walrasian to perfectly competitive equilibrium
  - All examples in the literature (including mine) are not perfectly competitive

- Longer term: experimentally test predictions

  - Currently talking with Cesar Martinelli about running at ICES lab

THP Equilibria Need Not Be Efficient
====================================

- Consider the following 2x2 game

- (Up, Left) is the unique THP equilibrium

- Selten (1975)'s original, extensive-form example is inefficient

- [Return](#thp)
---
Price-Taking Solves Hold-up
====================================

- With a hold-up problem, sellers may worry she faces a buyer that is a very tough bargainer

- The transfer to seller may not cover investment cost: `\(p(1)&lt;\frac{1}{4}\)`

- In that case, sellers want to invest as little as possible

- Price-taking ensures `\(p(1) \in \left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]\)`

`\(\Rightarrow\)` each side wants to invest as much as possible
