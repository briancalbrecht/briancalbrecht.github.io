Views of Politics
====================================

Government failure theory:

  - Political decision makers have power and can extract from citizens 
  
  - Politics involves concentrated benefits and dispersed costs (Olson 1965)
  
  - Politics as social conflict (Acemoglu 2003)
  
--

  - Douglass North (1995):
  
###.center[Institutions are **not** necessarily or even]
###.center[usually created to be **socially efficient**]

---
##Can Democratic Politics Be Efficient?

###Yes, if

1. Define away inefficiency

  - Cheung (1998): "The Pareto condition is always satisfied"
  
--

2. No transaction costs (Coase 1960)

  - Wittman (1989): "Democratic political markets are structured to reduce these costs"
  
--

3. Democracy **selects** for efficient policies
  - Today's presentation

---
Our Evolutionary Middle-ground
====================================


- Alchian (1950): profit mechanism selects for firms who have made relatively
better choices concerning profit-making

- In markets, selection replaces explicit choice of firm managers

`\(\Rightarrow\)` In the long-run, production is efficient

--

- **Our paper**: develop model of politics as dynamic, evolutionary process

- In politics, interest group formation replaces explicit choice of politicians

`\(\Rightarrow\)` In the long-run, policy is efficient

---
A Selection Mechanism
====================================


- At any point in time, interest groups may want to leave gains from trade on the table

- Once possible gains are large enough:
  - Interest groups pay cost to form,
  
  - Enter politics, and 
  
  - Overturn policies

- Interest group entry is a democratic selection mechanism

---
Preview of Results
====================================

- ### Proposition 1: 
  - Policy inefficiencies are eliminated in the long run

--

- ### Proposition 2: 
  - The level of inefficiency is bounded in the short run

--

- ### Proposition 3:
  - Policies remain in the dynamic problem that do not in the static


---
Building On
====================================
  
- Interest group models of politics

  - Stigler (1971), Peltzman (1976), Posner (1974), Becker (1983), Tollison (1988)
  
  - Focus on dynamic **selection mechanisms**
  
--

- Evolutionary perspective of institutions

  - Markets: Alchian (1950), Smith (2007), Todd and Gigerenzer (2012)
  
  - Common law: Rubin (1977), Priest (1977), Gennaioli and Shleifer (2007)
  
  - Focus on **legislative institutions**



---
Road Map for Talk
====================================

1. Simple Coasean Example: Static Bargaining
  
2. Real Option: Dynamic Bargaining

3. Model Results

  a. Formal Propositions
  
  b. Broader Implications

---
Static Political "Coase" Theorem
====================================

- Suppose competing interest groups bargain over policy
  - e.g. steel producers vs. steel consumers

- Steel producers want to enact tariffs with benefit `\(B\)` to them

- Consumers would incur a cost `\(C\)`

- Without transaction costs, new policy is enacted if `\(B &gt; C\)`

---
Static Political "Coase" Theorem
====================================

- In a competitive model, tariffs are inefficient: `\(B &lt; C\)`

- Consumers can organize into their own interest group and block tariff

- Consumers can offer to pay producers an amount `\(B + \epsilon &lt; C\)`

- Without transaction costs, the no tariff policy is efficient and enacted

--

- Yet we see many tariffs: why?

- As Coase taught us, there must be relevant transaction costs

---
Adding Organizational Costs
====================================


- Cost of organizing an interest `\(~O_i\)` for `\(i \in \{P,C\}\)`

- Producers want to organize and enact tariff if `\(B - O_P &gt; 0\)`

- If `\(B&lt;C\)`, to prevent inefficient tariff, consumers must form and pay a bribe, costing them:  `$$\underbrace{B - O_P + \epsilon}_{\textrm{Bribe/Transfer}} + \underbrace{O_C}_{\textrm{Organizational Cost}}$$`

--

- If `\(B &lt; C\)`, but `\(B + \epsilon + (O_C - O_P) &gt; C\)`, then bribe will never materialize

- Consumers are better off living with `\(C\)` than working to prevent

- `\(O_C - O_P\)` creates friction that prevents efficient bargains (Olson 1965)



---
Moving to Dynamics
====================================

- These examples can't speak to long-lasting vs. temporary policies
  - No distinction in Becker (1983), Wittman (1989), Peltzman (1990), etc

- These examples are like a one time, eternal vote on policy

- A policy passed last week is just as likely to be inefficient as long-lasting and widespread policies

--

- We argue there is an important difference

- Long-lasting policies have survived an (imperfectly) competitive selection mechanism

# Real Options in Politics


---
Beyond Political "Coase" Theorem
====================================
- `\(N = C - B\)`: net social cost of the current policy

- If `\(N\)` is positive, current policy is **inefficient** 
  - Current policy fails standard cost/benefit

- In a Coasean world with no transaction costs, the policy will be overturned

--

- We have two frictions:
  1. Organizational costs
  2. Uncertainty about future cost of policy


---
Adding Uncertainty
====================================



- The interest group always has the option to enter the political market and end the costly policy

- Option to enter is like a financial option

--

- If steel productivity in foreign countries follows a random walk, then cost of tariff `\(C\)` will follow a random walk

- Once `\(C\)` crosses some threshold, the consumer group will enter and **select the efficient** policy




---
Asymptotic Efficiency
====================================

### Proposition 1: The probability that any inefficient policy `\(j\)` survives goes to zero as time goes to infinity.
--
Idea: 

- Two things can happen over time:
  - `\(N \to -\infty\)`: efficient
  - `\(N \to \infty\)`: worth overturning

---

## "Every durable social institution or practice is efficient, &lt;br&gt; or it would not persist over time."

.right[George Stigler (1992)]


---
Bounded Inefficiency
====================================

### Proposition 2: For any parameters, there is an upper bound on the level of inefficiency.

--

- Corollary: The bound is increasing in the organizational costs, `\(O_j\)`.

- Similar result to static example with `\(O_C - O_P\)`


---
Dynamic vs. Static 
====================================
### Proposition 3: Policies remain in the dynamic problem that do not in the static problem.

- People prefer to wait and see if the net costs are moderate before paying the organizational costs

- If costs remain moderate, people will be willing to tolerate them

---
Model Implications
====================================

1. Losers must be compensated 

2. Durable legislation improves efficiency

3. Lowering political organizational costs improves efficiency



---
Just Compensation (Cutsinger 2018)
====================================

- In 2010, the House of Representatives changed significantly

- They eliminated a housing counseling assistance program 

- Program had given $88 million to non-profit organization

- Justice Department's settlement authority restored half of funding

- $30 million came from large banks based on their conduct in the mortgage backed securities market


---
Durability of Legislation
====================================

- Settlement authority makes policy effectively **more durable**: even if overturned, must be paid value of rents

- Durability raises `\(E\int_0^{\infty} e^{-\rho t} C_j(t) dt\)` and encourages entry


- If legislation is likely to be overturned later legislatures, willingness to pay `\(O_j\)` drops

--

- Similar result to principal-agent models of politicians:

  - Future benefits encourage efficient action today

- `\(\Rightarrow\)` Institutions that enhance durability improve efficiency


---
Independent Judiciary 
====================================


- If durability has value, then legislatures will have an incentive to make it difficult to overturn legislation 

- Landes and Posner (1975): independent judiciary can favor original interpretations and need not be subservient to current legislatures

- Anderson, Shughart, and Tollison (1989): legislatures reward judges who display independence with higher salaries

- Implication: judicial independence could explain variation in interest group
formation and the efficiency of policy


---
Free Speech
====================================

- Our most direct implication: lower `\(O_j\)` improves efficiency

- U.S. Supreme Court upheld freedom of speech for corporations, unions, and non-profits
making explicit reference to interest groups

- Justice Kennedy argued in favor of the **informational role** of interest groups, not just constitutional rights

- Speech restrictions increase the organizational costs

- If our theory is correct, the ruling is efficiency enhancing


---
Re-framing Political Economy
====================================

Normative Implications:

- Propositions 1 and 2 lead to a *pre*sumption of efficiency 
  (Breton 1993)
  
- However, policies are **not efficient by assumption**
  - Avoid "whatever is, is efficient" tautologies
  
--
  
- Between government failure and "efficiency always"

- Long last policies likely have a hidden efficiency justification
  - Hendrickson, Salter, and Albrecht (2018): capital taxation helps for national defense 


---
Implication for Political Economy
====================================


- Political economists who want to argue that a particular long-lasting policy is inefficient must

  1. Reconsider the magnitude of the cost of the policy, or
  
  2. Explain why the organizational costs are so high
  
- Otherwise, political economists can go around claiming there are $10 trillion bills on the sidewalk

---
Re-framing Political Economy
====================================

Positive Implications:

- Role of political economist is to identify the relevant organizational costs

- Retain efficiency as a tool for positive economics

- Mirrors Steven Cheung's (1998) approach to study of markets:

.center["whenever the Pareto condition fails to hold we would]
.center[immediately know that some constraints are missing."]
