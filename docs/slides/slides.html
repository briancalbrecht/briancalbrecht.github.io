Competitive Coordination
====================================

- Real investments are sunk in the face of possible coordination problems
  - Write a JMP before knowing the topic is unpopular
  - Invest in education before signing a wage contract
  - Produce goods before having a buyer
--
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
- When investments are sunk before entering a competitive market, **coordination problems** can arise*, leading to 
  1. under-investment equilibria,
  2. over-investment equilibria, and
  3. mismatch equilibria

- Are the sunk investments we see likely to be inefficient?

- I will argue **no**, if people are price-takers

- Inefficient equilibria are not robust to a reasonable refinement: trembling hand perfection

Perfection
====================================

- Selten (1975): rational behavior is a limiting case of irrational behavior

- "Trembles" are mistakes to explain off-path moves

--

- Coordination failures require pessimistic conjectures off-equilibrium, such as `\(p=0\)`

- The off-equilibrium conjectures are "too strong" 


- Any conjectures should be disciplined even off-path

- Disciplined conjectures with price-taking `\(\Rightarrow\)` efficient equilibria, even with sunk investments


&lt;!-- For general games, trembling hand perfect equilibria [can be inefficient](#thp_proof) --&gt;

---
Continuum Example
====================================

- Buyers pick `\(b \in B\)`, sellers pick `\(s \in S\)`

- Suppose `\(B = S = [0,1]\)`, continuum of buyers and sellers

- Cost to buyer = `\(\frac{1}{4}b\)`;  Cost to seller = `\(\frac{1}{4}s\)`

- Surplus `\(v(b,s) = bs\)` is split through transfer to seller `\(p(s)\)`

---
Investment Equilibrium
====================================

1. Prices clear matching market

1. Each buyer `\(i\)` chooses `\(b\)` to maximize utility, given price conjectures: `\(\tilde{p}^i(s)\)`

2. Each seller `\(j\)` chooses `\(s\)` to maximize utility, given price conjectures: `\(\tilde{p}^j(s)\)`

3. Rational conjectures: conjectures are not contradicted by the data
  - If `\(s\)` exists in the economy, `\(\tilde{p} (s) = p(s)\)`
  - If `\(s\)` does not, conjectures are not pinned down 
    
--

- Equilibrium does not require optimization "off-path" (like Nash)
  

- Continuum of Investment equilibria:
  - Efficient: `\(b=s=1\)`
  - Worst: `\(b=s=0\)`



---
Perturbed Strategies
====================================

- Each player's strategy: a CDF over attributes `\([0,1]\)`

- Uniform trembling hand: each attribute must be chosen with positive probability density `\(\epsilon&gt;0\)` by each buyer and seller
  - Requires the slope of the CDF to be everywhere greater than `\(\epsilon\)`
  - Assume the restriction holds in the aggregate
  
- Perfect equilibrium: limit of some sequence of `\(\epsilon\)`

- Claim: The unique perfect equilibrium allocation is efficient

  
---

- With trembling hand, each `\(s\)` is played `\(\Rightarrow\)` `\(\tilde{p}^i(s) = \tilde{p}^j(s) = p(s)\)`

- If `\(p(1) &gt; \frac{1}{4}\)`, sellers want to choose `\(s=1\)` as much as possible: `\(1 - \epsilon\)`

- If `\(p(1) &lt; \frac{3}{4}\)`, buyers want to choose `\(b=1\)` as much as possible: `\(1 - \epsilon\)`

--

- For any perturbation, 
`$$p(1) \in \left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]$$`


- As perturbations go to zero, `\((1,1)\)` is the unique equilibrium strategy profile
  - Prices are not necessarily unique


--

- **Main Theorem**: for a general class of assignment models with investments, all *perfect* investment equilibria are efficient


---
Simple General Mechanism
====================================

- Coordination problems arise because markets are incomplete

- &lt;b&gt;And&lt;/b&gt; people must hold conflciting, pessimistic conjectures
  - Buyers: `\(\tilde{p}^i(1) &gt; \frac{3}{4}\)`
  - Sellers: `\(\tilde{p}^j(1) &lt; \frac{1}{4}\)`

--

- Possible "mistakes" by others constrain conjectures: `\(p(1) \in \left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]\)`

- Under a trembling hand perturbation `\(\epsilon&gt;0\)` , all `\(b \in B\)` and `\(s \in S\)` are played

- Refined beliefs are constrained to be as-if markets were complete

- Complete markets `\(\Rightarrow\)` efficiency

---
Stage 1: Types
====================================
- Following Makowski (2004)

- Buyer names: `\(i \in I\)` `\(~~~~\)` Seller names: `\(j \in J\)`

- Types: `\(\beta : I \to \mathfrak{B}\)` `\(~~~~\)`  `\(\sigma : J \to \mathfrak{S}\)`

- Possible types: `\(t \in \mathcal{T} = \mathfrak{B} \cup \mathfrak{S}\)`

- Economy: a positive measure on `\(\mathcal{T}\)`: `$$\mathcal{E} \in M_+(\mathcal{T})$$`



---
Stage 1: Attributes
====================================
- Each individual must acquire/invest in one attribute from an interval `\(\textbf{A} = \textbf{B} \cup \textbf{S} \subset \mathbb{R}, \textbf{B} \cap \textbf{S} = \{\emptyset\}\)`

- Type determines cost of acquiring attribute `$$c : \textbf{A} \times \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{R} \cup {\infty}$$`

- `\(c(a,t)\)` is the cost of acquiring `\(a\)` for type `\(t\)`

--

- Individual choices lead to distribution of attributes `\(\mu \in M_+(\textbf{A})\)`

- For any Borel subset `\(E \subset B \cup S\)`, `\(\mu(E)\)` is the mass of individuals with attributes in `\(E\)`

---
.center[![](../images/tikz_c.png)]

--

- I assume "naive" perfect competition in the continuum through price-taking

- Everyone acts like price-takers, even when they do not face perfectly elastic demand and supply curves

- Ultimately, I don't want to assume price-taking but prove as in Gretsky, Ostroy, &amp; Zame (1999) or Makowski (2004)


---
Stage 2: Assignment Game
====================================

- To allow individuals to remain unmatched, let `\(\textbf{B}^0 \equiv \textbf{B} \cup {0}\)` and `\(\textbf{S}^0 \equiv \textbf{S} \cup {0}\)`

- An assignment is a measure `$$x \in M_+ (\textbf{B}^0 \times \textbf{S}^0)$$`

- An assignment `\(x\)` is **feasible** for `\(\mu\)` if `\(x(0,0)=0\)`, and for all Borel subsets, `\(E \subset \textbf{B}\)` and `\(F \subset \textbf{S}\)`,
`$$x(E, \textbf{S}^0) = \mu(E)$$`
`$$x(\textbf{B}^0, F) = \mu(F)$$`



---
Value Functions
====================================
- Bounded continuous value function: `\(v : \textbf{B}^0 \times \textbf{S}^0 \to \mathbb{R}\)`
  - In general, no further assumptions
  - When `\(v\)` is supermodular, coordination problems are possible*


- Social assignment gains function given `\(\mu\)`
`$$g(\mu) \equiv \text{sup} \int v dx~~~ s.t. x \text{ is feasible given } \mu$$`
- An allocation that attains `\(g(\mu)\)` is **conditionally efficient**

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/font&gt;

---
Two Margins in the Continuum
====================================
- Commodity margin: if `\(\textbf{A} = \mathbb{R}_+, \frac{\partial c(a,t)}{\partial a}\)`

- Individual margin: because individuals are infinitesimal, we can think of **prices for people**

- Price of sellers: `\(p : \textbf{S}^0 \to \mathbb{R}\)` 
  - With transferable utility, this price will transfer utility to the seller
  
---
Stage 2: Equilibrium
====================================
&lt;font color=#125972&gt;&lt;b&gt;Definition:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The pair `\((x,p)\)` is an (ex post) **Walrasian equilibrium** for `\(\mu\)` if `\(x\)` is feasible for `\(\mu\)`, `\(p(0) \equiv 0\)`,
--

- For each `\(b \in  \text{supp } \mu\)` and each `\((b,s) \in \text{supp } x,\)`

`$$v(b,s) - p(b,s)= v_b^*(p) \equiv \max_{s' \in \textbf{S}^0} v(b,s') - p(s')$$`
--

- For each `\(s \in  \text{supp } \mu\)` and each `\((b,s) \in \text{supp } x,\)`, `\(b \in \textbf{B}\)` implies 

`$$p(b,s) = v_s^*(p) \equiv \max \left\{p(b,s), v(0,s)\right\},$$`

---
Stage 2: Efficiency
====================================
- **Conditional First Welfare Theorem**:  If a pair `\((x,p)\)` is Walrasian for `\(\mu\)`, then it is conditionally efficient

- It is conditional because maximization only holds within the support

- `\(\mu\)` may be missing the efficient `\(b\)` and `\(s\)`

- Given the choice in a non-cooperative setting, do people choose the efficient `\(b\)` and `\(s\)`?

---
Stage 1: Attributes
====================================

- Fix the ex ante population `\(\mathcal{E}\)`

- An allocation of attributes is a measure `\(\nu \in M_+(\textbf{A}\times T)\)`
  - Marginals: `\(\nu_{\textbf{A}}, \nu_T\)`
  - `\(\mu = \nu_{\textbf{A}}\)`
  
- An allocation `\(\nu\)` is *feasible* for `\(\mathcal{E}\)` if `\(\nu_T = \mathcal{E}\)`


---
Equilibrium
====================================

- A pair `\((\nu, p)\)` is an **investment equilibrium** for `\(\mathcal{E}\)` if `\(\nu\)` is feasible, `\(p\)` is a Walrasian price for `\(\mu\)`, and for all `\((a,t) \in \text{supp } \nu\)`

`$$v_a^*(p) - c(a,t) \geq v^*_{a'}(p) - c(a',t) ~~~\forall a' \in \textbf{A}$$`

---
Efficiency
====================================

- Total cost of attributes `\(\nu\)` is `\(\int c d\nu\)`

- Total surplus from `\(\nu\)` is
`$$G(\nu) = g(\nu_{\textbf{A}}) - \int c d\nu$$`

- The allocation `\(\nu\)` is efficient for `\(\mathcal{E}\)` if it is feasible and `\(G(\nu) \geq G(\nu')\)` for all other feasible allocation `\(\nu'\)`

---
Return to Example
====================================

- Consider again the continuum example `\(B=S=[0,1]\)`

- Surplus: `\(v(b,s) = b s\)`

- For all buyers, `\(b=0\)`, for all sellers `\(s=0\)`, and `\(p(b,s)=0\)` is an investment equilibrium

- No profitable deviation
`$$\underbrace{0}_{\text{Surplus}} - \underbrace{0}_{\text{Transfer}} - \underbrace{0}_{\text{Cost of }b=0} \geq \underbrace{0}_{\text{Surplus}} - \underbrace{0}_{\text{Transfer}} - \underbrace{\frac{1}{4}b}_{\text{Cost of }b&gt;0}$$`

---
Perturbations
====================================

- Consider a perturbed strategy vector for all buyers `\(i \in I\)`, `\(\epsilon_B = (\epsilon(b))_{b \in B},\)` satisfying  `\(\epsilon(b)&gt;0\)` for all `\(b \in B\)` and 
`$$\int_B \epsilon(b)db \leq 1$$`
- For all sellers `\(\epsilon_S = (\epsilon(s))_{s \in S},\)` satisfying  `\(\epsilon(s)&gt;0\)` for all `\(s \in S\)` and 
`$$\int_S \epsilon(s)ds \leq 1$$`

- A perturbed games is index by the set of perturbed strategy vectors `\(\epsilon = (\epsilon_B,\epsilon_S)\)`

---
`\(\epsilon\)`-Investment Equilibria
====================================

- An allocation `\(\nu(\epsilon)\)` is `\(\epsilon\)`-feasible for `\(\mathcal{E}\)` if  `\(\nu_T = \mathcal{E}\)` and for all `\(a \in \textbf{A}\)`
`$$\nu_{\textbf{A}}(\epsilon(a)) \geq \epsilon(a)$$`

- A pair `\((\nu(\epsilon), p)\)` is an `\(\epsilon\)`-investment equilibrium for `\(\mathcal{E}\)` if `\(\nu\)` is `\(\epsilon\)`-feasible, `\(p\)` is a Walrasian price for `\(\mu\)`, and for all `\((a,t)\)` such that `\(\nu_{\textbf{A}}(\epsilon) &gt; \epsilon\)`,

`$$v_a^*(p) - c(a,t) \geq v^*_{a'}(p) - c(a',t) ~~~\forall a' \in \textbf{A}$$`

--

- Note that by construction, `\(\text{ supp } \nu_{\textbf{A}}(\epsilon) = \textbf{A}\)`


- A pair `\((\nu,p)\)` is a **perfect investment equilibria** if there exists a sequence of `\(\epsilon\)`, such that `\(\lim_{k \to \infty} M(\epsilon^k)=0\)` such that `\((\nu(\epsilon^k),p) \to (\nu,p)\)`.

---
Constrained Efficiency
====================================
- The allocation `\(\nu(\epsilon)\)` is `\(\epsilon\)`-efficient for `\(\mathcal{E}\)` if it is feasible and `\(G(\nu(\epsilon)) \geq G(\nu'(\epsilon))\)` for all other `\(\epsilon\)`-feasible allocation `\(\nu'\)`

- **Lemma**: If `\((\nu(\epsilon), p)\)` is an `\(\epsilon\)`-investment equilibrium, then it is `\(\epsilon\)`-efficient.


--

Proof: 

- Let `\(\nu'(\epsilon)\)` be any allocation `\(\epsilon\)`-feasible for `\(\mathcal{E}\)`
 
- Let `\(Q(i) = v_b^*(p) - c(b,i)\)` and `\(Q(j) = v_s^*(p) - c(s,j)\)`

---
Proof (continued)
====================================

- `\((\nu(\epsilon),p)\)` is an `\(\epsilon\)`-investment equilibrium so for each attribute played strictly more often than required by a buyer
`$$v(b,s) - c(b,i) - p(b,s) \leq Q(i)$$`


- Similarly, for each seller
`$$p(b,s) - c(s,j) \leq Q(j)$$`
--

- Hence,
`$$\int v(b,s) - c(b,i) - c(s,j) d\nu'(\epsilon) \leq \int Q(i) + Q(j) d\nu'(\epsilon) = G(\nu((\epsilon)))$$`
- Where the last quality comes because there full support so `\(Q(i)\)` and `\(Q(j)\)` is optimal over all `\(s\)` and `\(b\)`

---
Full Efficiency
====================================

- **Proposition**: If `\((\nu, p)\)` is a perfect investment equilibrium, then it is efficient.

--

Proof: 

- As `\(\epsilon \to 0\)`, consider each part of the previous inequality
`$$\int v(b,s) - c(b,i) - c(s,j)  d\nu'(\epsilon) \to \int v(b,s) - c(b,i) - c(s,j) d\nu$$`
$$ \int Q(i) + Q(j) d\nu'(\epsilon) \to \int Q(i) + Q(j) d\nu$$
`$$G(\nu((\epsilon))) \to G(\nu)$$`

---
Asymptotics
====================================

- The model assumes a continuum of agents
  - Therefore, the efficient action is taken by at least one person of each type
  
- However, for any finite economy, that is not true

- Trembling hand perfection already involves a limit: `\(\epsilon \to 0\)`

- Generally, asymptotics about the economy involve the size of the economy getting larger: `\(|I| + |J| \to \infty\)`
  - In particular, we can consider any replica economy, indexed by `\(N\)`

- The result holds if we consider
  `$$\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \lim_{N \to \infty}$$`

---
Conclusion
====================================

- In an Walrasian assignment model with investment, every perfect equilibrium is efficient

- In equilibrium, markets are endogenous and incomplete

- Mathematical mechanism: trembles generate complete markets

- My argument: with price-taking, coordination failures rely on overly pessimistic conjectures

--

- *Lots* to do:
  - Clean up lots of math and make precise notions of convergence, etc
  - Drop assumption of price-taking
  - Test in lab???

THP Equilibria Need Not Be Efficient
====================================

- Consider the following 2x2 game

  .center[![](../images/tikz_a.png)]

- (Up, Left) is the unique THP equilibrium

- Selten (1975)'s original, extensive-form example is inefficient


- [Return](#thp)

---
Price-Taking Solves Hold-up
====================================

- With a hold-up problem, sellers may worry she faces a buyer that is a very tough bargainer

- The transfer to seller may not cover investment cost: `\(p(1)&lt;\frac{1}{4}\)`

- In that case, sellers want to invest as little as possible

- Price-taking ensures `\(p(1) \in \left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]\)`

`\(\Rightarrow\)` each side wants to invest as much as possible
