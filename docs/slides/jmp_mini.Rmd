Competitive Coordination
====================================

- Important investments are sunk in the face of possible coordination problems

  - Invest in education before being hired
  - Produce goods before having a buyer
  - Write a JMP before knowing the topic is unpopular
  
--
<br>

- When investments are sunk before entering a **competitive market**, coordination problems can still arise
  - Makowski & Ostroy (1995), Cole, Malaith, & Postlewaite (1999a, 1999b), Makowski (2004), N&ouml;ldeke & Samuelson (2014), Felli & Roberts (2016)

My JMP
====================================


- Are the sunk investments we see likely to be inefficient?

- **No**, if markets are competitive

- Formally, inefficient equilibria are not robust to a reasonable refinement: trembling hand perfection

---
Sketch of Environment
====================================

- Continuum of buyers and sellers, finite types

- Transferable utility

Results so far
=====================

- **Theorem 1**: With a continuum of players, every perfect equilibria is efficient.

- **Theorem 2**: In the limit of any sequence of finite games, every perfect equilibria is efficient.

---
Simple General Mechanism
====================================

- Coordination problems arise because markets are incomplete

- <b>And</b> people must hold conflicting, pessimistic conjectures
  - Buyers think price will be high
  - Sellers think price will be low

--

- Possible "mistakes" by others constrain conjectures

- Under a trembling hand perturbation, all strategies are played

- Refined beliefs are constrained to be as-if markets were complete

- Complete markets $\Rightarrow$ efficiency


---
Road Forward
=======================

- Extend to imperfectly transferable utility case
  - More relevant for matching literature

- Drop price-taking assumption to study boundaries of perfect competition
  - Conjecture: With small trembles, an economy with inefficient investment is not approximately competitive
