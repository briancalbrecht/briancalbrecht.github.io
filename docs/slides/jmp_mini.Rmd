Competitive Coordination
====================================

- Real investments are sunk in the face of possible coordination problems
  - Invest in education before signing a wage contract
  - Produce goods before having a buyer lined up
  - Write a JMP before knowing the topic is unpopular
--
<br>
<br>
- When investments are sunk before entering a competitive market, **coordination problems** can arise*

- $\Rightarrow$ People may underinvest in skills

My JMP
====================================


- Are the sunk investments we see likely to be inefficient?

- **No**, if people are price-takers

- Formally, inefficient equilibria are not robust to a reasonable refinement: trembling hand perfection

---
Sketch of Environment
====================================

- Continuum of buyers and sellers, finite types

- Quasi-linear utility

Simple General Mechanism
====================================

- Coordination problems arise because markets are incomplete

- <b>And</b> people must hold conflicting, pessimistic conjectures
  - Buyers think price will be high
  - Sellers think price will be low

--

- Possible "mistakes" by others constrain conjectures

- Under a trembling hand perturbation, all strategies are played

- Refined beliefs are constrained to be as-if markets were complete

- Complete markets $\Rightarrow$ efficiency


---
Road Forward
=======================

- What I Have Proven:

  - With a continuum of players, every perfect equilibria is efficient

  - In an appropriate limit of any sequence of finite games, every perfect equilibria is efficient


- Next Steps:

  - Extend to imperfectly transferable utility case

  - Drop price-taking assumption to study boundaries of perfect competition
