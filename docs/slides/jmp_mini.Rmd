Competitive Coordination
====================================

- Important investments are sunk before entering a market

  - Invest in education before being hired
  - Produce goods before having a buyer
  - Write JMP before knowing if schools want a general equilibrium theorist
  
--

- When investments are sunk (incomplete markets), coordination failures can arise even with **competitive markets**
  - Makowski & Ostroy (1995), Cole, Malaith, & Postlewaite (1999a, 1999b), Makowski (2004), N&ouml;ldeke & Samuelson (2014), Felli & Roberts (2016)

--
  
- Previous literature only studies **existence** of coordination failures

---
My Question
====================================

- Are the sunk investments we see out the window likely to be inefficient? 

- Are coordination failures **robust**?

--


## My Answer

- **No**, if markets are competitive

- Formally, inefficient equilibria are not robust to a trembling-hand refinement

---
Sketch of My Environment
====================================

- Continuum of buyers and sellers, finite types

- Transferable utility (for now)

Results so far
=====================

- **Main Theorem**: With a continuum of players, every perfect equilibria is efficient

- Proposition: In the appropriate limit of any sequence of finite games, every perfect equilibria is efficient

---
Simple General Mechanism
====================================

- Coordination failures arise because markets are incomplete
  - Emphasis of literature

- **And** people must hold conflicting, pessimistic conjectures about prices
  - Buyers think price will be high
  - Sellers think price will be low

--

- Possibility of "mistakes" constrains equilibrium conjectures

- With a trembling-hand, all strategies are played

- Refined beliefs are constrained to be as-if markets were complete

- As-if complete markets $\Rightarrow$ efficiency


---
Road Forward
=======================

- Extend to imperfectly transferable utility case

  - Especially relevant for competitive matching models
  - N&ouml;ldeke & Samuelson (2014, 2018) provide framework

--

- Drop price-taking assumption to study boundaries of perfect competition
  - All examples in the literature are **not perfectly competitive**
  - Conjecture: With small trembles, an economy with inefficient investment is not approximately competitive

- Any applications?
